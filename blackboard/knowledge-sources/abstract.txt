Abstract knowledge source

The abstract knowledge source (``AbstractKS`` class) is the base class for all
knowledge sources in the blackboard system. The corresponding file
:file:`AbstractKS.m` is located in the ``src/blackboard_core`` directory as
opposed to all implementations of actual knowledge sources that are located in
the directory ``src/knowledge_sources``. The listing below shows the parts most
relevant to development of new knowledge sources::

    class AbstractKS
        properties
            blackboard;
            blackboardSystem;
            invocationMaxFrequency_Hz;
            trigger;
        events
            KsFiredEvent
        methods (Abstract)
            canExecute()
            execute()
        methods
            focus()
            unfocus()

There are different aspects of functionality in this interface.

Data access
    Knowledge sources have a handle to the ``blackboard``. Through this handle,
    data can be placed on and retrieved from the blackboard.

System setup
    Through the handle ``blackboardSystem``, knowledge sources get access to the
    methods for adding and removing other knowledge sources, and also access to
    the ``BlackboardMonitor``.

Execution properties
    The property ``invocationMaxFrequency_Hz`` specifies how often this
    knowledge source is allowed to be executed. The methods ``focus`` and
    ``unfocus`` give access to the attentional priority of the knowledge source,
    which influences its relative importance when competing for computing
    resources with other knowledge sources. See SectionÂ :ref:`sec-scheduler` for
    a description of scheduling.

Execution conditional
    The abstract method ``canExecute`` must be implemented by the inheriting
    knowledge source. It is called by the scheduler when the knowledge source is
    next in the schedule before actually executing.  If this method returns
    false, execution will not be performed. The second output argument of this
    method indicates whether the knowledge source should remain in the agenda or
    be removed.

Execution
    The main functionality of any knowledge source is implemented in the method
    ``execute``. A knowledge source gets executed by the scheduler if its
    maximum invocation frequency would not be exceeded and its ``canExecute``
    method returns true. In this method, a knowledge source gets access to its
    ``trigger``, a structure that contains information about the triggering
    event, the triggering source, and an argument the trigger source placed for
    usage by sinks.

Events
    Knowledge sources can define their own individual events. However, each
    class already inherits a standard event from ``AbstractKS``,
    ``KsFiredEvent``. Events can be triggered by knowledge sources via
    ``obj.notify(eventname, attachedData)``.
