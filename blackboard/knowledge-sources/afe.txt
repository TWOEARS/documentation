Auditory front-end knowledge source: ``AuditoryFrontEndKS``
-----------------------------------------------------------

    :local:

This knowledge source integrates the |AFE| into the |blackboard|. The |AFE|
itself is a self-contained module and this section focuses on its integration
within the framework.

The |AFE| knowledge source is connected to the blackboard and the `robot
interface
<http://twoears.github.io/binaural-simulator-doc/classsimulator_1_1_robot_interface.html>`_
by registering itself in the system via ``BlackboardSystem.setDataConnect``.
Upon construction, the |AFE| ``dataObject`` and ``managerObject`` are
instantiated and connected to the robot interface ear signals stream. The
maximum invocation frequency of the ``AuditoryFrontEndKS`` is set to infinity.
Execution mainly consists of getting the latest chunk of ear signals data,
processing it through the |AFE|, and notifying a ``KsFiredEvent``.

Other knowledge sources can register requests with the |AFE| indirectly, through
inheriting from the ``AuditoryFrontEndDepKS`` class (see
SectionÂ :ref:`sec-afe-dep-knowledge-source`, and binding to it's
``KsFiredEvent``.
