The |blackboard| is targeted as the front-end for a great variety of
applications, providing an architecture that integrates experience formation and
active behaviour from a set of different functional modules. These modules can
work on different levels of abstraction, independently from each other or in
collaboration, in a bottom-up or top-down manner. A key feature of this system
should be its ability to evolve, so that easy modification, exchange and/or
extension of modules can be achieved within a scalable architecture.

This document will provide you an overview about the blackboard architecture
that is used together with the :ref:`knowledge sources <sec-knowledge-sources>`
in order to provide such a system.
