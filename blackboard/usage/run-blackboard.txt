Execution
---------

The following example code fragment shows how to run the blackboard system. It
is assumed that the XML files ``Scene.xml`` and ``Blackboard.xml`` have
previously been created and are on your Matlab path. 

.. code-block:: Matlab
    :linenos:

    bbs = BlackboardSystem(0);
    sim = simulator.SimulatorConvexRoom('Scene.xml');
    bbs.setRobotConnect(sim);           
    bbs.buildFromXml('Blackboard.xml'); 
    bbs.run();

In the first line, a ``BlackboardSystem`` object is created. The parameter to
the constructor (in this case, zero) indicates the verbosity level. In line 2 a
room simulation is created from the scene description file ``Scene.xml``. Line 3
then connects the blackboard to this simulator front end (at this stage you
could also connect it to a real :ref:`robot platform <sec-robot>`). Finally, in
line 4 the blackboard is built from the configuration file ``Blackboard.xml``
and line 5 runs the blackboard; it will now proceed in a run loop until there is
no more data to process.
