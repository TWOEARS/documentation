-- Versioning --
This repo contains the latest version of git.m.
Whenever there is a stable release, the submission on MATLAB Central's File Exchange will be periodically synched from the latest stable release here.

The generic version is git.m, tested to work on OS X and GNU/Linux.
Windows derivatives are separate submissions by third-parties and are listed in the Windows folder.

-- OS, Distributions --
This version was developed on OS X, but is expected to work on BSD and Linux flavors alike.
Windows is a different beast, and it's never been tested on Windows.
