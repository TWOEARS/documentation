Binaural simulator
==================

The Two!Ears Binaural Simulator enables you to create dynamic binaural ear
signals, that can be used by later parts of the model to actively explore a
scene.

* :doc:`Installation <binsim/install>`
* :doc:`Usage <binsim/usage>`
* :doc:`Examples <binsim/examples>`

Robotic platform
================

If you have a robotic platform ready to record the binaural signals, no
simulation of them will be needed. Learn to set up your own robot below:

Auditory front-end
==================

The Two!Ears Auditory Front-End extracts all kinds of auditory cues from the ear
signals like the loudness or interaural differences. For detailed description
see:

* :doc:`Introduction <afe/index>`
* :doc:`Overview <afe/overview>`
* :doc:`Technical description <afe/description>`
* :doc:`Available processors <afe/processors>`
* :doc:`Add your own processor <afe/add-processor>`

Blackboard system
=================

The Two!Ears Blackboard System is the *brain* of the Two!Ears Auditory Model as
it provides a way to interpret the auditory cues and extract meaning from them.
Learn how this happens below:

Database
========

The Two!Ears Binaural Simulator and the Two!Ears Blackboard System uses a lot of
different data to perform their tasks. This is achieved by a large collection of
data:

Evaluation
==========

A key concept of the Two!Ears Auditory Model is reproducible research. Here, you
will find scripts that can redo plots of our publications.
