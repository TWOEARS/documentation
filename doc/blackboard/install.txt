Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

The |blackboard| is positioned more at the end part of the complete |TwoEars|
chain. That means that you first have to ensure that all the needed modules are
installed.

You have to provide the blackboard with some input signals which will come from
the |binsim| or the |robot| and which are very likely processed by the |AFE|
in between. Depending on your work flow those modules have to be installed and
running.
