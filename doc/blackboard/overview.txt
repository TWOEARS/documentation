Overview of software architecture
=================================

The goal of the Two!Ears project is to develop an intelligent, active
computational model of auditory perception and experience in a
multi-modal context. In order to do so, the system must be able to
recognise acoustic sources and optical objects, and achieve perceptual
organisation of sound in the same manner as human listeners do. [Bregman1990]_ has
referred to the latter phenomenon as *ASA*, and to reproduce this ability in
a machine system a number of factors must be considered:

-  ASA involves diverse sources of knowledge, including both primitive
   (innate) grouping heuristics and schema-driven (learned) grouping
   principles;

-  Solving the ASA problem requires the close interaction of top-down and
   bottom-up processes through feedback loops;

-  Auditory processing is flexible, adaptive, opportunistic and
   context-dependent.

The characteristics of ASA are well-matched to those of *blackboard*
problem-solving architectures. A blackboard system consists of a group
of independent experts (*knowledge sources*) that communicate by reading
and writing data on a globally-accessible data structure (*blackboard*).
The blackboard is typically divided into layers, corresponding to data,
hypotheses and partial solutions at different levels of abstraction.
Given the contents of the blackboard, each knowledge source indicates
the actions that it would like to perform; these actions are then
coordinated by a scheduler, which determines the order in which actions
will be carried out.

Blackboard systems were introduced by [Erman1980]_ as an architecture for speech
understanding, in their Hearsay-II system. In the 1990s, a number of
authors described blackboard-based systems for machine hearing [Cooke1993]_,
[Lesser1995]_, [Ellis1996]_, [Godsmark1999]_. All of
these systems were in most respects ‘conventional’ blackboard
architectures, in which the knowledge sources employed rule-based
heuristics. In contrast, the Two!Ears architecture aims to exploit
recent developments in machine learning, by combining the flexibility of
a blackboard architecture with powerful learning algorithms afforded by
probabilistic graphical models.

    Overview of the general software architecture across all
    work-packages.

The general structure of the complete Two!Ears software architecture is
shown in Figure :ref:`fig-blackboard-architecture`.
Since Deliverable D3.1, major progress has been made
towards integration of all related software modules across work
packages. The current system includes the auralization environment
developed by WP1, which is interfaced with the peripheral processing and
feature extraction stage of WP2. The blackboard system, developed by WP3, acts
as the core of the integrated framework and provides additional
interfaces to include feedback mechanisms investigated within WP4 and a
robotic interface to communicate with WP5. Recent development on the
[Morse2014]_ software architecture is focused on integrating simulated visual
processing, based on the simulator provided by WP5, into the framework.
This will provide capabilities necessary to simulate acoustic and visual
scenes that will be investigated within the Two!Ears application
scenarios.

In the following sections, we describe in more detail the progress on
the design and implementation of the integrated framework as well as
individual knowledge sources.
