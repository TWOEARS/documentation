Add your own knowledge sources
==============================

If you want to add some new functionality to the |TwoEarsModel| the best way to do
this is to add a :ref:`knowledge source <sec-knowledge-source>`. This implies of
course that the auditory cues or data that your new knowledge source will need
is already available. To check this first, have a look at all the
:ref:`available processors <sec-afe-processors>` of the |AFE|. If the cues you
need are not provided then read on :ref:`how to add them
<sec-afe-add-processor>`. Otherwise you can go on and create your own knowledge
source. For understanding the full potential that is available with knowledge
sources like dynamic data initialisation of other knowledge sources or data
requests you should familiarise yourself first with the :ref:`blackboard
architecture <sec-blackboard-architecture>`.
