Usage
=====

The database is located at the following address:
https://dev.qu.tu-berlin.de/projects/twoears-database, where you can browse the
data, download the whole database or single files.

If you want to use the data with the |TwoEarsModel| you don't have to download any
data yourself, all you have to do is to know which data you want to use and
specify its relative location in the database. For example, in order to use the
anechoic :abbr:`HRTF (head related transfer function)` data set measured at 3 m
distance with the KEMAR dummy head you have to add the following address to
your scene configuration (see :ref:`sec-xml-scene-description`):

.. code-block:: xml

    <scene HRIRs="impulse_responses/qu_kemar_anechoic/QU_KEMAR_anechoic_3m.sofa">

The data will then be automatically downloaded by the |binsim| during processing
and stored in a local cache.

.. warning::

    Write something about the cache. Where is it, how to clear it ...
