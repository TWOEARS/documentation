Sound databases
===============

This is a collection of different sound databases. A sound database can be
anything that comes as a collection of related sound files like a speech corpus.

Speech databases

.. _sec-grid-corpus:

GRID corpus
~~~~~~~~~~~

GRID is a large multi-talker audiovisual sentence corpus to support joint
computational-behavioural studies in speech perception. In brief, the corpus
consists of high-quality audio and video (facial) recordings of 1000 sentences
spoken by each of 34 talkers (18 male, 16 female). Sentences are of the form::

    put red at G9 now

The database provided here is a subset of the original database containing 360
randomly selected sentences for each speaker. More details about GRID can be
found on the `GRID website`_ or in the corresponding `GRID paper`_.

The GRID corpus, together with transcriptions, is freely available for research
use.

Usage
^^^^^

Each speaker comes with separate folder containing 360 sentences::

    sound_databases/grid_subset/s1/bbaf2n.wav
    ...
    sound_databases/grid_subset/s1/swwv9a.wav
    sound_databases/grid_subset/s2/bbaf1n.wav
    ...
    sound_databases/grid_subset/s34/swws3n.wav

All available files are listed in::

    sound_databases/grid_subset/flist.txt

Acoustic scenes and events
--------------------------

.. _sec-ieee-aasp:

IEEE AASP Challenge on Detection and Classification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This data set includes binaural recordings acoustic environmental scenes. It can
be used for classification tasks of acoustic scenes and events.

Usage
^^^^^

In the ``scenes/`` folder stereo recordings of the following acoustic scenes are
provided:

    | bus
    | busystreet (busy street with heavy traffic)
    | office
    | openairmarket (open-air or semi-open market)
    | park
    | quietstreet (quiet street with mild traffic)
    | restaurant

    |   networks)
    | tubestation (tube station in the Transport for London, Underground and
    |   Overground, train networks, either subterranean or supraterranean)

Each class contains ten recordings. Each recording is 30 s long. Files are named
according to the class name, i.e. ``classXX.wav`` where ``XX`` is a two-digit,
non-consecutive number.

In the ``events_single_sounds/`` folder stereo recordings of the following
acoustic events are provided:

    | alert
    | clearthroat
    | cough
    | doorslam
    | drawer
    | keyboard
    | keys
    | knock
    | laughter
