==================
Binaural simulator
==================

The |BinSim| enables the creation of binaural audio signals
for different situations. This is done via the usage of head-related transfer
functions (HRTFs) or binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs), which are provided
in the Two!Ears data repository. All the needed data will be downloaded on
demand from the data repository via a http connection. The simulation framework
can be used as one module in the |AFE|. The |BinSim| uses the signal processing
core of the SoundScape Renderer.

The next sections will help you to set up the |BinSim| and define and simulate
your own acoustic scenes with it. The installation process is a little bit more
complicated than with normal Matlab scripts as we are using a C++ core for the
audio rendering which is included as a mex-file. If you have trouble during the
installation, don't hesitate to write a mail to the |twoears| mailing list.
