==================
Binaural simulator
==================

The |BinSim| enables the creation of binaural audio signals for different
situations. This is done via the usage of :abbr:`HRTF (head-related transfer
function)`\ s or :abbr:`BRIR (binaural room impulse response)`\ s, which are
provided in the |database|. All the needed data will be downloaded on demand
from the data repository via a http connection.  The next sections will help you
to set up the |BinSim| and define and simulate your own acoustic scenes with it.

For all its calculations the |BinSim| uses the signal processing core of the
`SoundScape Renderer`_ which is written in C++ and provided via a mex-file to
Matlab. If you have problems with the provided mex-files, see the
:ref:`sec-binsim-install` for how to compile them yourself.  If you have trouble
during the installation, don't hesitate to write a mail to the
|TwoearsMailingList|.
