========================================
|BASS|, an audio streaming server module
========================================


|BASS| is a |GenoM3| module in charge of acquiring binaural audio data from a
hardware sound interface, and making it available to other components, branded
as clients of |BASS|.

The module offers services to start and stop the acquisition of audio data, and
streams the captured data on an output port. A sliding window of the most recent
data is kept on the port, the size of which can be set at runtime (for instance,
the port keeps the last 2 seconds of acquired signals).

|BASS| relies on |ALSA| to communicate with the hardware interface.

|BASS| terminology
------------------

This section defines the notions and the vocabulary that |BASS| uses.

Interface and device
  They are synonyms for the hardware board in charge of converting analog sound
  signals into digital streams.

Acquisition and capture
  They are synonyms for retrieving audio data from microphones through an audio
  interface.

Binaural audio and channels
  **Binaural audio** consists of two **channels** (like stereo audio),
  corresponding to left and right audio streams.

Samples and frames
  A **sample** is a digital value encoding the signal on one channel at one
  point in time. A **frame** is a collection of samples, one from each channel,
  at one point in time (thus for binaural audio, a frame is two samples).

Chunks
  In capturing state, the sound device regularly delivers blocks of new data to
  the module. These blocks are called **chunks**. The size of these chunks
  (commonly given in amount of frames) can be chosen when starting an
  acquisition, and is then fixed for this acquisition.

Note that these definitions can differ from other applications where the word
*frame* may refer to data blocks of a few milliseconds. Here, these blocks are
rather called *chunks*, a frame being a single point in time.


Services
--------

Services offered by the |BASS| module are defined in the description file
:file:`bass-genom3/bass.gen`, along with their documentation. This section
recaps them and adds a few specifications.

* The ``ListDevices`` service can be called to print the available sound devices
  for acquisition on standard output.

* The ``Acquire`` service starts the acquisition of audio data and updates the
  output port with captured data (see details about the port in section
  :ref:`sec-bass-output-port`). This service expects 4 input parameters, shown
  in table :ref:`tab-bass-acquire-input-params`.

  .. _tab-bass-acquire-input-params:

    +-----------+--------------------+--------------+----------------------+

  The ``device`` parameter can be found by calling the ``ListDevices`` service
  mentioned above first. The ``nFramesPerChunk`` parameter is important, as
  smaller chunks will lead to shorter latency but also higher computational
  demand. Last, the ``nChunksOnPort`` parameter sets the amount of chunks kept
  on the port. With the default values given above, 20 chunks of 2205 frames is
  a total of 44100 frames kept on the port, i.e. 1 second of audio data at the
  default sample rate.

  The ``Acquire`` service can return an exception if the configuration of the
  interface fails (*e.g.* the requested sample rate is not supported), if a
  problem occurs during the acquisition (*e.g.* the interface gets unplugged),
  *etc.* If an exception occur, the user can get more information by reading the
  message printed on standard error stream.

* The ``Stop`` service stops the acquisition of audio data. (Note that the
  ``Acquire`` service also interrupts itself, so a new acquisition with
  different parameters can directly be started from a running one without having
  to call ``Stop``).

.. _sec-bass-output-port:

Output port
-----------

Data captured by the ``Acquire`` service are streamed on an output port named
``Audio`` (defined in :file:`bass-genom3/bassInterface.gen`). They are gathered
in two arrays, one for each channel, updated with a |FIFO| design: every time a
new chunk is retrieved from the hardware interface, the content of the arrays is
shifted, deleting the oldest chunk of data and making room to the newest one, as
detailed below.

At the beginning of the acquisition, the arrays are filled with zeros and the
first captured chunks are progressively added. For instance, the state of one
array before and after adding the 4th chunk is illustrated here (assuming that
the port is longer than 4 chunks)::

  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
  |                 zeros                 |   1   |   2   |   3   |
  |                                       |       |       |       |
  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

                                          /       /       /
                                         /       /       /
  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
  |             zeros             |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |

  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+


The length of the port is a round number of chunks, set with parameter
``nChunksOnPort`` of the ``Acquire`` service (noted :math:`COP` below). The size
of one chunk is also set when calling ``Acquire``, with parameter
``nFramesPerChunk`` (noted :math:`FPC` below). Thus, the left and right arrays
contain :math:`FPC*COP` samples each. Once the port is entirely filled with data
(all beginning zeros have been erased), the oldest chunk is deleted as a new
chunk arrives::

  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
  |   1   |   2   |   3   |          ...          | COP-1 |  COP  |
  | (old) |       |       |                       |       |       |
  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
           /       /                                       /
          /       /                                       /
         /       /                                       /

  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
           /       /                                       /
          /       /                                       /
         /       /                                       /
  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

In order to let the clients keep track of the data and detect any loss, the port
also publishes an index that indicates the number of frames that have been
streamed since the beginning of the acquisition. In other words, it is the index
of the last streamed frame, noted ``lastFrameIndex``. The data structure of the
``Audio`` output port (defined in :file:`bass-genom3/bassStruct.idl`) is
summarized in table :ref:`tab-bass-port-struct`.

* The ``sampleRate``, ``nChunksOnPort`` and ``nFramesPerChunk`` members are set
  as input parameters of the ``Acquire`` service.

* The ``left`` and ``right`` members are dynamic arrays (``sequence<long>``
  type) of :math:`FPC*COP` samples. Samples are signed integers coded on 32 bits
  (``long`` type).

* The index for tracking data is stored in the ``lastFrameIndex`` member. As
  this index is incremented by :math:`FPC` frames every time a new chunk is
  published on the port, it is important to check that it will not overflow. The
  index is therefore coded as an unsigned integer on 64 bits (``unsigned long
  long`` type. With a sample rate of 192kHz for instance, the order of magnitude
  of the index overflow is a million years).
