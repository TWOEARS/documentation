Installation of the robotic tools
=================================

The robotic tools should be installed on any system that hosts components of the
software architecture for the |robot|. This section details the installation
process.

.. note::

    For all the guidelines gathered here, we will assume that you are using
    Ubuntu GNU/Linux as it is the supported distribution for |ROS| (though any
    other UNIX platform should be suited to the |GenoM3| tools). Many commands
    given here are intended for the :command:`bash` shell. If you use a
    different shell, you should adapt the bash-related commands accordingly.

Install |ROS|
-------------

The |ROS| distribution you can install will depend on your Ubuntu version:

* If you have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or 13.10, follow the `ROS Indigo`_ installation
  instructions.
* Otherwise, follow the `ROS Hydro`_ installation instructions.

.. _ROS Indigo: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu
.. _ROS Hydro: http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu

Install the |GenoM3| tools through |robotpkg|
---------------------------------------------

This section will guide you through the installation of |GenoM3| tools. |GenoM3|
is open-source software (available at https://git.openrobots.org/) and can be
compiled from source, but the common installation uses |robotpkg|, a compilation
framework and packaging system for robotics software (more information at
http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/).

Get |robotpkg| on your system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

     The following instructions invite you to download two git repositories. If
     the given URLs using ``git://`` protocol fail, try ``https://`` protocol as
     instructed `here <http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/install.html>`_ and `there
     <http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/robotpkg-wip.html>`_.

First, get the ``robotpkg`` repository in your home folder (you can choose
another location, but we recommend this one):

.. code-block:: bash

    cd
    git clone git://git.openrobots.org/robots/robotpkg

You will also need the `wip <http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/robotpkg-wip.html>`_
subset of |robotpkg|, it contains some work in progress that is not officially
released, but already available:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/robotpkg
    git clone git://git.openrobots.org/robots/robotpkg/robotpkg-wip wip

Next, set the installation path. The tools that you will soon install will be
placed in your home folder under a dedicated folder named
``openrobots``. Installing robotic components in your home folder ensures that
you do not need root privileges for the installation (you can choose another
location with a different prefix, but we recommend this one):

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/robotpkg/bootstrap
    ./bootstrap --prefix $HOME/openrobots

To finish, update your environment variables to include the installation
folder:

.. note::

    In the following commands, note the use of an environment variable
    :envvar:`ROBOTPKG_BASE` to indicate your installation path, set to
    ``$HOME/openrobots``. If you have selected a different location at the
    previous step, you should modify the corresponding command accordingly.

.. code-block:: bash

    echo >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "# ROBOTPKG" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "export ROBOTPKG_BASE=$HOME/openrobots" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "export PATH=$PATH:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/bin:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/sbin" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/lib/pkgconfig" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/src/ros-nodes:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/share" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/lib/python3.2/site-packages" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "# ROBOTPKG END" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

How to install a |robotpkg| package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your ``~/robotpkg`` directory contains a tree of packages, grouped into main
categories. In the next part, we will invite you to install some of those
packages. Here, we expose you the guidelines to follow for each package.

1. **Add options to the package**

    If you are asked to add options ``option-1 option-2 ...`` to the package
    ``pkg-name``, edit the file :file:`~/openrobots/etc/robotpkg.conf` and add a
    line (near the beginning for instance) looking like::

        PKG_OPTIONS.pkg-name+= option-1 option-2 ...

    You will get a better idea about this step with an actual example in the
    next part.

2. **Move to the package's directory**

    You will be given the path to the package, such as
    ``robotpkg/category/pkg-name``. Change to this directory:

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd ~/robotpkg/category/pkg-name

3. **Install possibly missing system dependencies**

    Run the following command to list the dependencies for the package you are
    about to install:

    .. code-block:: bash

        make show-depends

    At the end of the command's output, the dependencies are separated into
    ``Robotpkg dependencies`` and ``System dependencies``. If any |robotpkg|
    dependency is missing, it will be automatically installed. If any system
    dependency is missing, you need to install it (commonly with
    :command:`apt-get` under Ubuntu). Iterate this step until no system
    dependency is missing.

    You may skip this step, but if a system dependency is missing, the package
    installation will stop at some point and you will be asked to install it.

4. **Install the package**

    Run the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        make update

    This will download the sources, compile them locally on your system, and
    install the output files in the ``~/openrobots`` directory.

Install packages for |GenoM3|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Install the package ``demo-genom3`` from ``robotpkg/wip/demo-genom3`` with
  options ``codels ros-server ros-client-ros ros-client-c``.

    This package will install the *demo* module. It is a sample component
    distributed with |GenoM3|, serving as an example of a |GenoM3| module. It
    simply controls the motion of a fictional robot. The aim of installing the
    *demo* module is twofold: first, it automatically installs all the
    dependencies for using |GenoM3| (the provided options specifying that we
    will use the |ROS| templates); second, you get a |GenoM3| module ready to be
    run to start using the robotic tools.

    For your convenience, here is how applying the :ref:`above steps
    <sec-install-robotpkg-package>` could look like:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # 1. Add options to the package
        echo "PKG_OPTIONS.demo-genom3+= codels ros-server ros-client-ros ros-client-c" >> ~/openrobots/etc/robotpkg.conf
        # or better, edit the file manually and add the line near the beginning

        # 2. Change to the package's directory
        cd ~/robotpkg/wip/demo-genom3

        # 3. Install missing system dependencies
        make show-depends
        # Let's say that `make show-depends` revealed two missing system
        # dependencies named 'bison' and 'flex'. Next step would be:
        sudo apt-get install bison flex
        make show-depends
        # No missing system dependency left

        # 4. Install the package
        make update

* Then, install the packages ``genomix`` from ``robotpkg/net/genomix`` and
  ``rosix`` from ``robotpkg/net/rosix``.

    |genomix| and |rosix| are HTTP servers providing an interface for some
    clients to control |GenoM3| modules and generic |ROS| nodes respectively.

* Then, install the packages ``tcl-genomix`` from ``robotpkg/wip/tcl-genomix``
  and ``matlab-genomix`` from ``robotpkg/supervision/matlab-genomix``.

    These are clients of |genomix| and |rosix| servers. The |tcl-genomix| client
    allows to control components using the Tcl language. Its installation is not
    mandatory (we will rather use the |matlab-genomix| client), but recommended
    as a common package distributed with |GenoM3|. The |matlab-genomix| client
    allows to control components from Matlab.

    .. note::

        You need a Matlab installation on your system in order to install the
        ``matlab-genomix`` package. If you encounter a missing dependency for
        ``mex`` (the MEX compiler from Matlab), you need to add the path to
        Matlab executables to the :envvar:`PATH` environment variable. For
        example, with Matlab R2013a installed in ``/usr/local/MATLAB/R2013a``,
        it would be done with:

        .. code-block:: bash

            export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/MATLAB/R2013a/bin

The |GenoM3| tools should now be installed on your system. You can now follow
the `official tutorial on the Matlab bridge
<https://git.openrobots.org/projects/matlab-genomix/gollum/demo>`_ using the
demo module. The tutorial :ref:`sec-tutorial-bass` is also a simple example of use
of the Matlab bridge.

Keeping up-to-date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a new release is available for a package, you can update to newest contents:

1. **Update the git repositories**

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/robotpkg
    git pull
    cd wip
    git pull

2. **Change to the package's repository and update the package**

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/robotpkg/category/pkg-name
    make update

Install a |GenoM3| module from the sources
------------------------------------------

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The software part of the |TwoEars| robotic architecture includes several
|GenoM3| modules. You may have to install them from their source files. Each
|GenoM3| module has its own folder, containing a description file named after
the module with the ``.gen`` extension (something like
:file:`module.gen`). These steps will install the module in your
``~/openrobots`` folder:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd path/to/module/folder
    genom3 skeleton -i module.gen
    ./bootstrap.sh
    mkdir build && cd build
    ../configure --prefix=$ROBOTPKG_BASE --with-templates=ros/server,ros/client/ros,ros/client/c
    make install

Example: installing the |BASS| module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|BASS| is a :ref:`module for binaural audio streaming <sec-bass>`, located in a
sub-folder named ``RoboticPlateform/bass-genom3/`` of the software
repository. Applying the above commands to install |BASS| gives:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd RoboticPlateform/bass-genom3
    genom3 skeleton -i bass.gen
    ./bootstrap.sh
    mkdir build && cd build
    ../configure --prefix=$ROBOTPKG_BASE --with-templates=ros/server,ros/client/ros,ros/client/c
    make install
