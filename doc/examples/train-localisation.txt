(Re)train the localisation stage
================================

The localisation of the |TwoEarsModel| is performed by the `LocationKS` which
has a learned lookup table for :abbr:`ITD (interural time difference)`\ s and
:abbr:`ILD (interaural level difference)`\ s. For the ``default`` setting of
`LocationKS` this was trained with the
:file:`impulse_responses/qu_kemar_anechoic/QU_KEMAR_anechoic_3m.sofa` from the
database convolved with white noise.
The training was done for a resolution of 1Â°. This examples shows you how you
can retrain the model for other :abbr:`HRTF (head related transfer function)`\
s, other angular resolutions, and other source materials.
