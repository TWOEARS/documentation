Installation of the development version
=======================================

Getting the code
----------------

The development of the |TwoEarsModel| happens independently for its different
modules (see :doc:`../intro/modules`). All of them are hosted as git repositories
on github. For an overview go to https://github.com/TWOEARS.

.. note::

    |TwoEars| internally the development happens also under
    https://dev.qu.tu-berlin.de which holds code or data that cannot be made
    public, but otherwise the repositories at github should represent the actual
    status of the code.

In order to get started you should `familarize yourself with git`_ and then
start to clone the repository you would like to change the code.
Then you have to start with getting the `main repository`_ as all other modules
need some basic functionality from that one:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/TwoEars.git

In addition, single modules could depend on other modules.
For example, to work on the |AFE| you have to clone the tools repository as
well:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/auditory-front-end.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/tools.git

You can find the dependencies of a single module in its :abbr:`XML
(extended markup language)` configurations. In the case of the |AFE| it is
stored in the file :file:`AuditroyFrontEnd.xml` in its main directory of the
repository:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <!-- Configure dependency of the Two!Ears Auditory Front-End module -->

    <!-- Start the Two!Ears Auditory Front-End with
         startTwoEars('AuditoryFrontEnd.xml'); -->

    <requirements>
        <TwoEarsPart sub="src" startup="startAuditoryFrontEnd">auditory-front-end</TwoEarsPart>
        <TwoEarsPart branch="master" sub="src" startup="startTools" >tools</TwoEarsPart>
    </requirements>

In the `main repository`_ you will find the file :file:`TwoEars.xml` which
defines all modules that are part of the |TwoEarsModel|. If you want to start
the whole model you can simply run:

.. code-block:: Matlab

    >> startTwoEars;

Which would require all the modules cloned that are defined in
:file:`TwoEars.xml`. If you would only work on the |AFE| from the example above,
you have to start the model with the specific :abbr:`XML (extended markup
language)` configuration file:

.. code-block:: Matlab

    >> startTwoEars('AuditroyFrontEnd.xml');
