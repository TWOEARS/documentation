Setting up an acoustic scene
============================

The auditory models available normally work in a way that you have your
pre-recorded or generated signals that you used also in the experiments and then
simply feed them into your model and it returns the results.

For the |TwoEarsModel| this is slightly different as the model is allowed to
actively explore the provided acoustic scene. For example, it could decide to
turn its head in order to generate better predictions. This means the ear
signals have to be able to change accordingly. One way to achieve this is to use
a |robot| in order to record the signals on the fly. For an introduction to
that, see :ref:`sec-tutorial-robot`. Here, we will focus on the other way to
generate the ear signals by using our |BinSim|.

There are two operation modi the |BinSim| creates the ear signals. One way is to
specify your acoustic scene completely with metadata and the simulator then
renders it by using :abbr:`HRTF (head-related transfer function)` and its
:ref:`sec-binaural-renderer`. The other way is to use a mixture of metadata and
pre-recorded scene details as they could be stored in :abbr:`BRIR (binaural room
impulse response)` or :abbr:`BRS (binaural room scaning)` files [Horbach1999]_
using the :ref:`sec-brs-renderer`. :abbr:`BRIR (binaural room impulse
response)`\ s represent sources placed in a room. :abbr:`BRS (binaural room
scaning)` files could even include the simulation of complex scenarios like
loudspeaker arrays reproducing driven by spatial audio reproduction techniques
to generate a virtual sound source. Those files could also be
used in an experiment using dynamic binaural synthesis, see for example
[Wierstorf2014]_ and then feed directly into the model in order to predict the
results.
