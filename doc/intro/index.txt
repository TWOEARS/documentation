=======================
Two!Ears Auditory Model
=======================

**A computational framework for modelling active exploratory listening that
assigns meaning to auditory scenes**

The Two!Ears Auditory Model consists of several stages for modeling active human
listening. These stages include not only classical signal driven processing
steps like you can find in the `Auditory Modeling
Toolbox`_. It comes also with a complete acoustical simulation framework for
creating binaural ear signals for specified acoustical scenes. The classical
auditory signal processing is further accompanied by a black board architecture
that allows top-down processing and the inclusion of world knowledge to the
model.

The model is being developed by the partners of the `EU project Two!Ears`_.

Current state of the model
--------------------------

The development of the model did just start and its current version includes
only some of its stages. In end of June 2015 a first version, including several
of its modules will be released.
