The |TwoEarsModel| consists of several modules for modelling active human
listening. It could handle real recorded binaural data as well as simulated one
and can be freely configured to solve different tasks like localisation and
identification of speakers.

To get an overview of the single modules of the model, including a nice
sketch of the overall model have a look at the :ref:`sec-modules`.

In order to quickly get the model up and running, have a look at the
:ref:`sec-install`. And then see how to :ref:`sec-tutorial-acoustic-scene` and
:ref:`sec-tutorial-auditory-model`.

If you are curious on how to best get data from our huge |database| have a look
at :ref:`sec-tutorial-database`. And if you are ready to not only simulate
binaural ear signals, but really record them on the fly have a look at the
:ref:`sec-tutorial-robot`.

The model is being developed by the partners of the `EU project Two!Ears`_.
