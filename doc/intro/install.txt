Installation guide
==================

To install the |TwoEarsModel| download it from its `official download site`_ and
store it somewhere on your PC. The download includes only the files needed to
run it in Matlab, possible data files like :abbr:`HRTF (head related transfer
function)` will be later downloaded by the model on the fly if needed.

If stored on your PC you can add the main folder **without** its sub-folders to
your Matlab paths and then run::

    >> startTwoEars

Now everything is setup and you can use the model.
