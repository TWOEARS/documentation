Installation guide
==================

To install the |TwoEarsModel| download it from its `official download site`_ and
store it somewhere on your PC. The download includes only the files needed to
run it in Matlab. Additional files such as |HRTF| data will be downloaded later by
the model on-the-fly if needed. 

We have tested the software with Matlab versions 2012b and later. You will also need
the Signal Processing Toolbox.

.. warning::

    Is this correct? is there a minimum matlab version required for WP1 or WP2 code?
    What about tool boxes?

When stored on your PC, you should add the main folder to your Matlab path and then run the 
``startTwoEars`` function, which will add the necessary sub-folders and compile the
mex files. From within the main folder do the following::

    >> addpath(pwd)
    >> startTwoEars

Finally, in order to use the location knowledge source ``LocationKS()``, you need to install GMTK as follows.

Now everything is setup and you can use the model.
