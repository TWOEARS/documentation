Quick install guide
===================

its main repository:

* `Two!Ears`_
* `Two!Ears Binaural Simulator`_

.. _Two!Ears Binaural Simulator: https://github.com/TWOEARS/binaural-simulator
.. _Two!Ears Auditory Front-End: https://github.com/TWOEARS/auditory-front-end
.. _Two!Ears Blackboard System: https://github.com/TWOEARS/blackboard-system
.. _Two!Ears Tools: https://github.com/TWOEARS/tools
.. _Two!Ears Database: https://dev.qu.tu-berlin.de/projects/twoears-database
.. _SOFA: https://github.com/TWOEARS/SOFA

If you have downloaded the desired model part you have to setup the path
configuration file ``TwoEarsPaths.xml`` of the main repository to include your
local paths to all of the installed model parts. Please don't change the names
in the brackets like ``<auditory-front-end>``, they are used internally but put the
corresponding paths between the xml tags. On a linux PC the file could be
looking like this:

.. code:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <repoPaths>
        <binaural-simulator>~/git/twoears/binaural-simulator</binaural-simulator>
        <auditory-front-end>~/git/twoears/auditory-cues</auditory-front-end>
        <blackboard-system>~/git/twoears/cognition</blackboard-system>
        <tools>~/git/twoears/tools</tools>
        <sofa>~/git/twoears/sofa</sofa>
        <data>~/git/twoears/data</data>
    </repoPaths>

If you have set up all the paths you can start the model with::

    >> startTwoEars;
