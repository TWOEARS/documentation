The goal of the Two!Ears project is to develop an intelligent, active
computational model of auditory perception and experience in a
multi-modal context. The |AFE| 
represents the first stage of the system
architecture and concerns bottom-up auditory signal processing, which
transforms binaural signals into multi-dimensional auditory
representations. The output provided by this consists of several
transformed versions of ear signals enriched by perception-based
descriptors which form the input to the higher model stages. Specific
emphasis is given on the modularity of the software framework, making
this more than just a collection of models documented in the literature.
Bottom-up signal processing is implemented as a collection of processor
modules, which are instantiated and routed by a manager object. A
variety of processor modules is provided to compute auditory cues such
as rate-maps, interaural time and level differences, interaural
coherence, onsets and offsets. An object-oriented approach is used
throughout, giving benefits of reusability, encapsulation and
extensibility. This affords great flexibility, and allows modification
of bottom-up processing in response to feedback from higher levels of
the system during run time. Such top-down feedback could, for instance,
lead to on-the-fly changes in parameter values of peripheral modules,
like the filter bandwidths of the basilar-membrane filters. In addition,
the object-oriented  framework allows direct switching between
alternative peripheral filter modules, while keeping all other
components unchanged, allowing for a systematic comparison of
alternative processors. Finally, the framework supports online
processing of the two-channel ear signals.
