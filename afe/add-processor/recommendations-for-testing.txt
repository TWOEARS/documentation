Recommendations for final testing
---------------------------------

Now the implementation of your new processor should be finalised, and it is
important to test it thoroughly. Below are some recommendations with regard to
testing:

* Make sure that all aspects of your implementation work. Test for mono as well 
  as stereo input signals, vary your processor parameters and check that the 
  change is reflected accordingly in the output.
* If you have based your implementation on another existing implementation 
  (even better, one that is documented in the literature), then compare your new 
  implementation with the reference implementation and control that both 
  provide the same output up to a reasonable error. A reasonable error, for a 
  processor that does not involve stochastic processes should be around 
  quantisation error, assuming that your new implementation is exactly as the 
  reference.
* Test the online capability of your processor (i.e., maintaining the 
  continuity of its output) by processing a whole signal and the same signal 
  cut into chunks. Both runs should provide the same output (up to a 
  "reasonable error"). You can use the test script ``test_onlineVSoffline`` to 
  perform that task.
