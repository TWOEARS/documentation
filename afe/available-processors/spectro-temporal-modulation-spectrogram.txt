Neuro-physiological studies suggest that the response of neurons in the primary
auditory cortex of mammals are tuned to specific spectro-temporal
patterns [Theunissen2001]_, [Qiu2003]_. This response characteristic of neurons
can be described by the so-called |STRF|. As suggested by [Qiu2003]_, the |STRF|
can be effectively modelled by two-dimensional (2D) Gabor functions.  Based on
these findings, a spectro-temporal filter bank consisting of 41 Gabor filters
has been designed by [Schaedler2012]_.  This filter bank has been optimised for
the task of |ASR|, and the respective real parts of the 41 Gabor filters is
shown in :numref:`fig-gabor-2d`.

The input is a log-compressed rate-map with a required resolution of 100 Hz,
which corresponds to a step size of 10 ms. To reduce the correlation between
individual Gabor features and to limit the dimensions of the resulting Gabor
feature space, a selection of representative rate-map frequency channels will be
automatically performed for each Gabor filter [Schaedler2012]_. For instance,
the reference implementation based on 23 frequency channels produces a 311
dimensional Gabor feature space.

   Real part of 41 spectro-temporal Gabor filters. 

The Gabor feature processor is demonstrated by the script
``DEMO_GaborFeatures.m``, which produces the two plots shown in
:numref:`fig-gabor`. A log-compressed rate-map with 25 ms time frames and 23
frequency channels spaced between 124 and 3657 Hz is shown in the left panel for
a speech signal.  These rate-map parameters have been adjusted to meet the
specifications as recommended in the |ETSI| standard [ETSIES]_. The
corresponding Gabor feature space with 311 dimension is presented in the right
panel, where vowel transition (e.g.  at time frames around 0.2 s) are well
captured. This aspect might be particularly relevant for the task of |ASR|.
