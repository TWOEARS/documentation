This section presents a detailed description of all processors that are
currently supported by the |AFE| framework. Each processor can be controlled by
a set of parameters, which will be explained and all default settings will be
listed. Finally, a demonstration will be given, showing the functionality of
each processor. The corresponding Matlab files are contained in the |AFE| folder
``/test`` and can be used to reproduce the individual plots. A full list of
available processors can be displayed by using the command ``requestList``. An
overview of the commands for instantiating processors is given in 
:ref:`sec-computation-of-an-auditory-representation`.
