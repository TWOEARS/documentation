The |IC| is estimated by determining the maximum value of the normalised |CCF|.
It has been suggested that the |IC| can be used to select |TF| units where the
binaural cues (|ITD|\ s and |ILD|\ s) are dominated by the direct sound of an
individual sound source, and thus, are likely to reflect the true location of
one of the active sources [Faller2004]_.  The  |IC| processor does not have any
controllable parameters itself, but it depends on the settings of the |CCF|
processor, which is described in :ref:`sec-cross-correlation`. The |IC|
representation is computed by using the request entry ``’ic’``.

The application of the |IC| processor is demonstrated by the script ``DEMO_IC``,
which produces the following four plots shown in :numref:`fig-ic`. The top left
and bottom left panels show the anechoic and reverberant speech signal,
respectively. It can be seen that the time domain signal is smeared due to the
influence of the reverberation. The |IC| for the anechoic signal is close to one
for most of the individual |TF| units, which indicates that the corresponding
binaural cues are reliable. In contrast, the |IC| for the reverberant signal is
substantially lower for many |TF| units, suggesting that the corresponding
binaural cues might be unreliable due to the impact of the reverberation.

   corresponding |IC| (top right panel). Reverberant speech (bottom left panel)
