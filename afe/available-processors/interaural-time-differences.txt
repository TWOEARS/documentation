The |ITD| between the left and the right ear signal is estimated for individual
frequency channels and time frames by locating the time lag that corresponds to
the most prominent peak in the normalised |CCF|. This estimation is further
refined by a parabolic interpolation stage [May2011]_, [May2013b]_. The |ITD|
processor does not have any adjustable parameters, but it relies on the |CCF|
described in :ref:`sec-cross-correlation` and its corresponding parameters (see
:numref:`tab-crosscorrelation`). The |ITD| representation is computed by using
the request entry ``’itd’``.

The |ITD| processor is demonstrated by the script ``DEMO_ITD.m``, which produces
two plots as shown in :numref:`fig-itd`.  The ear signals for a speech source
that is located closer to the right ear are shown in the left panel. The
corresponding |ITD| estimation is presented for each individual |TF| unit (right
panel). Apart from a few estimation errors, the estimated |ITD| between both
ears is in the range of 0.5 ms for the majority of |TF| units.
