Following [Slaney1990]_, [Meddis2001]_, [Meddis1997]_, the sub-band periodicity
analysis obtained by the |ACF| can be integrated across frequency by giving
equal weight to each frequency channel.  The resulting |SACF| reflects the
strength of periodicity as a function of the lag period for a given time frame,
as illustrated in :numref:`fig-acf`. Based on the |SACF| representation, the
most salient peak within the plausible pitch frequency range ``p_pitchRangeHz``
is detected for each frame in order to obtain an estimation of the fundamental
frequency. In addition to the peak position, the corresponding amplitude of the
|SACF| is used to reflect the confidence of the underlying pitch estimation.
More specifically, if the |SACF| magnitude drops below a pre-defined percentage
``p_confThresPerc`` of its global maximum, the corresponding pitch estimate is
considered unreliable and set to zero. The estimated pitch contour is smoothed
across time frames by a median filter of order ``p_orderMedFilt``, which aims at
reducing the amount of octave errors.  A list of all parameters is presented in
:numref:`tab-pitch`. In the context of pitch estimation, it will be useful to
experiment with the settings related to the non-linear pre-processing of the
|ACF|, as described in :ref:`sec-auto-correlation`.

The task of pitch estimation is demonstrated by the script ``DEMO_Pitch`` and
the corresponding |SACF| plots are presented in :numref:`fig-pitch`. The pitch
is estimated for an anechoic speech signal (top left panel). The corresponding
is presented in the top right panel, where each black cross represents the most
salient lag period per time frame. The plausible pitch range is indicated by the
two white dashed lines. The confidence measure of each individual pitch
estimates is shown in the bottom left panel, which is used to set the estimated
pitch to zero if the magnitude of the |SACF| is below the threshold. The final
pitch contour is post-processed with a median filter and shown in the bottom
right panel.  Unvoiced frames, where no pitch frequency was detected, are
indicated by ``NaN``\ 's.

   panel). The confidence measure based on the |SACF| magnitude is used to
   select reliable pitch estimates (bottom left panel). The final pitch estimate
   is post-processed by a median filter (bottom right panel).
