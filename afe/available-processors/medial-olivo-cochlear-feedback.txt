It has now been a well known fact that in the auditory system, an efferent
pathway of fibers exists, originating from the auditory neurons in the olivary
complex to the outer hair cells  [Guinan2006]_. This operates as a top-down
feedback path, as opposed to the bottom-up peripheral signal transmission
towards the brain, affecting the movement of the basilar membrane in response to
the input stimulus. The |MOC| processor mimics this feedback, particularly
originating from the medial part of the olivary complex. In |AFE|, this feedback
is realised by monitoring the output from the ratemap processor which
corresponds to the auditory neurons' firing rate, and by controlling accordingly
the nonlinear path gain of the |DRNL| processor which corresponds to the basilar
membrane's nonlinear operation. This approach is based on the work of
[Clark2012]_, except that the auditory nerve processing model is simplified as
the ratemap processor in |AFE|.

The input to the |MOC| processor is the time frame-frequency representation from
the ratemap processor. This is then converted into an attenuation factor per
each frequency channel. The constants for this rate-to-attenuation conversion
are internal parameters of the processor, which can be set in accordance with
various physiological findings such as those of [Liberman1988]_. The amplitude
relationship was adopted from the work of [Clark2012]_. The time course and
delay of the feedback activity, such as in the work of [Backus2006]_, can be
approximated by adjusting the leaky integrator time constant ``rm_decaySec`` and
the window step size ``rm_hSizeSec`` of the ratemap processor.

In addition to this so-called reflexive feedback, realised as a closed-loop
operation, the reflective feedback is realised by means of additional control
parameters that can be modified externally in an open-loop manner. The two
parameters ``moc_mocIpsi`` and ``moc_mocContra`` are included for this purpose.
Depending on applications, these two can be accessed and adjusted via the
Blackboard system, and applied jointly with the reflexive feedback to the
nonlinear path as the final multiplicative gain factor. :numref:`tab-moc` lists
the parameters for the processor, including the above-mentioned two. The other
two parameters ``moc_mocThresholdRatedB`` and ``moc_mocMaxAttenuationdB`` are
specified such that the input level- attenuation relationship is fitted best to
the data of [Liberman1988]_ which is scaled within a range of 0 dB to 40 dB
by [Clark2012]_.

:numref:`fig-moc` shows, firstly on the left panel, the input-output
characteristics of the |MOC| processor, using on-frequency stimulation from
tones at 520 Hz and 3980 Hz, same as in the work of [Liberman1988]_. As mentioned
above, the relationship between the input level and the |MOC| attenuation
activity through the ratemap representation was derived through curve fitting to
the available data set of [Liberman1988]_, which is also shown on the plot. An
example of input signal-|DRNL| output pair at 40 dB input level is shown on the
right panel. The feedback applies an attenuation at the later part of the tone.
These plots can be generated by running the script ``DEMO_MOC.m``.

    on-frequency tone stimulus at 520 Hz and 3980 Hz. The data set
    of [Liberman1988], scaled as in the work of [Clark2012], is also shown for
    comparison. Right panel: |DRNL| processor output (bottom) from a 50 ms tone
