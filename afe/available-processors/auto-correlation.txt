Auto-correlation is an important computational concept that has been extensively
studied in the context of predicting human pitch perception [Licklider1951]_,
[Meddis1991]_. To measure the amount of periodicity that is present in
individual frequency channels, the |ACF| is computed in the |FFT| domain for
short time frames based on the |IHC| representation. The *unbiased* |ACF|
scaling is used to account for the fact that fewer terms contribute to the |ACF|
at longer time lags. The resulting |ACF| is normalised by the |ACF| at lag zero
to ensure values between minus one and one. The window size ``ac_wSizeSec``
determines how well low-frequency pitch signals can be reliably estimated and
common choices are within the range of 10 milliseconds – 30 milliseconds.

For the purpose of pitch estimation, it has been suggested to modify the signal
prior to correlation analysis in order to reduce the influence of the formant
structure on the resulting |ACF| [Rabiner1977]_. This pre-processing can be
activated by the flag ``ac_bCenterClip`` and the following nonlinear operations
can be selected for ``ac_ccMethod``: centre clip and compress ``’clc’``, centre
clip ``’cc’``, and combined centre and peak clip ``’sgn’``.  The percentage of
centre clipping is controlled by the flag ``ac_ccAlpha``, which sets the
clipping level to a fixed percentage of the frame-based maximum signal level.

A generalised |ACF| has been suggested by [Tolonen2000]_, where the exponent
``ac\_K`` can be used to control the amount of compression that is applied to
the |ACF|. The conventional |ACF| function is computed using a value of
``ac\_K=2``, whereas the function is compressed when a smaller value than 2 is
used. The choice of this parameter is a trade-off between sharpening the peaks
in the resulting |ACF| function and amplifying the noise floor. A value of
``ac\_K = 2/3`` has been suggested as a good compromise [Tolonen2000]_. A list
of all |ACF|-related parameters is given in :numref:`tab-acorr-parameters`. Note
that these parameters will influence the pitch processor, which is described in
:ref:`sec-pitch`.

A demonstration of the |ACF| processor is shown in :numref:`fig-acf`, which has
been produced by the scrip ``DEMO_ACF.m``.  It shows the |IHC| output in
response to a 20 ms speech signal for 16 frequency channels (left panel). The
corresponding |ACF| is presented in the upper right panel, whereas the |SACF| is
shown in the bottom right panel. Prominent peaks in the |SACF| indicate lag
periods which correspond to integer multiples of the fundamental frequency of
the analysed speech signal. This relationship is exploited by the pitch
processor, which is described in :ref:`sec-pitch`.
