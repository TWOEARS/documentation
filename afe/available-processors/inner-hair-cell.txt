The |IHC| functionality is simulated by extracting the envelope of the output of
individual gammatone filters. The corresponding |IHC| function is adopted from
the |amtoolbox| [Soendergaard2013]_. Typically, the envelope is extracted by
combining half-wave rectification and low-pass filtering. The low-pass filter is
motivated by the loss of phase-locking in the auditory nerve at higher
frequencies [Bernstein1996]_, [Bernstein1999]_. Depending on the cut-off
frequency of the |IHC| models, it is possible to control the amount of
fine-structure information that is present in higher frequency channels. The
cut-off frequency and the order of the corresponding low-pass filter vary across
methods and a complete overview of supported |IHC| models is given in
:numref:`tab-ihc-models`.  A particular model can be selected by using the
parameter ``ihc_method``.

The effect of the |IHC| processor is demonstrated in :numref:`fig-ihc`, where
the output of the gammatone filter bank is compared with the output of an |IHC|
model by running the script ``DEMO_IHC.m``.  Whereas individual peaks are
resolved in the lowest channel of the |IHC| output, only the envelope is
retained at higher frequencies.
