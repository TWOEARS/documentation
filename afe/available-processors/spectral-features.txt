In order to characterise the spectral content of the ear signals, a set of
spectral features is available that can serve as a physical correlate to
perceptual attributes, such as timbre and coloration [Peeters2011]_. All
spectral features summarise the spectral content of the rate-map representation
across auditory filters and are computed for individual time frames. The
following 14 spectral features are available:

#. ``'centroid'`` : The spectral centroid represents the centre of gravity of
   the rate-map and is one of the most frequently-used timbre
   parameters [Tzanetakis2002]_, [Jensen2004]_, [Peeters2011]_. The centroid is
   normalised by the highest rate-map centre frequency to reduce the influence
   of the gammatone parameters.

#. ``'spread'`` : The spectral spread describes the average deviation of the
   rate-map around its centroid, which is commonly associated with the bandwidth
   of the signal. Noise-like signals have usually a large spectral spread, while
   individual tonal sounds with isolated peaks will result in a low spectral
   spread. Similar to the centroid, the spectral spread is normalised by the
   highest rate-map centre frequency, such that the feature value ranges between
   zero and one.

#. ``'brightness'`` : The brightness reflects the amount of high frequency
   information and is measured by relating the energy above a pre-defined cutoff
   frequency to the total energy. This cutoff frequency is set to ``sf_br_cf =
   1500`` Hz by default [Jensen2004]_, [Peeters2011]_. This feature might be
   used to quantify the sensation of sharpness.

#. ``'high-frequency content'`` : The high-frequency content is another metric
   that measures the energy associated with high frequencies. It is derived by
   weighting each channel in the rate-map by its squared centre frequency and
   integrating this representation across all frequency channels [Jensen2004]_.
   To reduce the sensitivity of this feature to the overall signal level, the
   high-frequency content feature is normalised by the rate-map integrated
   across-frequency.

#. ``'crest'`` : The |SCM| is defined as the
   ratio between the maximum value and the arithmetic mean and can be used to
   characterise the peakiness of the rate-map. The feature value is low for
   signals with a flat spectrum and high for a rate-map with a distinct spectral
   peak [Peeters2011]_, [Lerch2012]_.

#. ``'decrease'`` : The spectral decrease describes the average spectral slope
   of the rate-map representation, putting a stronger emphasis on the low
   frequencies [Peeters2011]_.

#. ``'entropy'`` : The entropy can be used to capture the peakiness of the
   spectral representation [Misra2004]_. The resulting feature is low for a
   rate-map with many distinct spectral peaks and high for a flat rate-map
   spectrum.

#. ``'flatness'`` : The |SFM| is defined as
   the ratio of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean and can be used to
   distinguish between harmonic (|SFM| is
   close to zero) and a noisy signals (|SFM|
   is close to one) [Peeters2011]_.

#. ``'irregularity'`` : The spectral irregularity quantifies the variations of
   the logarithmically-scaled rate-map across frequencies [Jensen2004]_.

#. ``'kurtosis'`` : The excess kurtosis measures whether the spectrum can be
   characterised by a Gaussian distribution [Lerch2012]_. This feature will be
   zero for a Gaussian distribution.

#. ``'skewness'`` : The spectral skewness measures the symmetry of the spectrum
   around its arithmetic mean [Lerch2012]_. The feature will be zero for silent
   segments and high for voiced speech where substantial energy is present
   around the fundamental frequency.

#. ``'roll-off'`` : Determines the frequency in Hz below which a
   pre-defined percentage ``sf_ro_perc`` of the total spectral energy is
   concentrated. Common values for this threshold are between ``sf_ro_perc =
   0.85`` [Tzanetakis2002]_ and ``sf_ro_perc = 0.95`` [Scheirer1997]_,
   [Peeters2011]_. The roll-off feature is normalised by the highest rate-map
   centre frequency and ranges between zero and one. This feature can be useful
   to distinguish voiced from unvoiced signals.

#. ``'flux'`` : The spectral flux evaluates the temporal variation of the
   logarithmically-scaled rate-map across adjacent frames [Lerch2012]_. It has
   been suggested to be useful for the distinction of music and speech signals,
   since music has a higher rate of change [Scheirer1997]_.

#. ``'variation'`` : The spectral variation is defined as one minus the
   normalised correlation between two adjacent time frames of the
   rate-map [Peeters2011]_.

A list of all parameters is presented in :numref:`tab-spectral-features`.

The extraction of spectral features is demonstrated by the script
``Demo_SpectralFeatures.m``, which produces the plots shown in
:numref:`fig-spec-features`.  The complete set of 14 spectral features is
computed for the speech signal shown in the top left panel. Whenever the unit of
the spectral feature was given in frequency, the feature is shown in black in
combination with the corresponding rate-map representation.
