The feature creator is responsible for making requests to the |AFE| and extracting 
features from blocks o time windows obtained from the auditory representation. 
The feature creator can be used to apply transformations to the auditory representations such as 
averaging between left and right channels, computing derivatives, computing statistics over spatio-temporal features, etc.
The extracted features will then be used for training a model. The feature creator can also be used inside an :ref:`sec-afe-dep-knowledge-source` for making the request and 
driving an already trained model with the features it requires for inference. :ref:`sec-identity-knowledge-source` is an example of knowledge source that operates in this manner. 

Some of the available feature creators
--------------------------------------

This is a short list of some of the feature creators already available in the pipeline:

FeatureSet3Blockmean
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature creator requests :ref:`sec-amplitude-modulation-spectrogram`, :ref:`sec-rate-map` and :ref:`sec-spectral-features` from the |AFE|.
It then computes the mean across the left and right channels. The magnitudes in the each representation are re-scaled to fall within the [0,1] range. Features are summarized by computing L-Moments over the temporal dimension as well as the summary of the first and second derivatives of those representations.

Intended to be used alongside an identification model.

FeatureSet4Blockmean
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature creator is similar to ``FeatureSet3Blockmean`` excpet that it makes an additional request to the |AFE|, namely Gabor filter responses and that the number of frequency channels are different. The handling of the features remains the same.

Intended to be used alongside an identification model.

FeatureSetNSrcDetection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Intended to be used alongside a model for estimating the number of active sound sources.

FeatureSetNSrcDetectionPlusModelOutputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uses ``FeatureSetNSrcDetection`` internally and extends the feature set by adding the output of other models (e.g. sound source localization  estimates)

Intended to be used alongside a model for estimating the number of active sound sources.
