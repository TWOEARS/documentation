The Auditory Machine Learning Training and Testing Pipeline (AMLTTP) is an object-oriented framework for building and
evaluating models for auditory sound object annotation and assigning
attributes to them. It faciliatates the training of models by inductive learning from labeled training data. The framework is called the amlttp. It is tightly
coupled with the |TwoEars| system and its components. The |amlttp| consists of two
parts, namely generating model training and testing data and carrying out the actual training as well as testing of models. Each part is broken down into further sub-stages and components. While the pipeline is designed with flexibility in mind and is extendable to new target attributes, data features, or model and training algorithms, it serves the specific purpose of training and evaluation of block-based auditory object-*type* (|IdentityKS|, |SegmentIdentityKS|), object-*location*, and *number-of-sources* |NumberOfSourcesKS| classifiers
using data from simulated auditory scenes generated within the same
framework.

The |amlttp| is developed by Ivo Trowitzsch from Technische Universit√§t
Berlin, and the rest of the `Two!Ears team`_.
