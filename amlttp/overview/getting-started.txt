The |amlttp| was developed entirely using Matlab version R2015b. It was tested for backward compatibility down to Matlab. The source code, test and demo scripts are
all available from the public repository at
https://github.com/TWOEARS/Auditory-Machine-Learning-Training-and-Testing-Pipeline.

All files are divided into three folders: ``/src``, ``/test`` and ``/third_party_software``
containing respectively the source code, various test scripts and source files of external software used throughout |amlttp|. Once Matlab opened, the source code directory (and if needed the
other folders) should be added to the Matlab path. This can be done by executing
the script ``startAMLTTP`` in the root directory::

    >> startAMLTTP;
