Usage
=====

As explained in the :ref:`sec-tutorial-database` tutorial the database is
located at https://dev.qu.tu-berlin.de/projects/twoears-database, but you don't
have to download any files yourself as this is automatically performed by the
|BinSim| or by explicitly calling ``xml.dbGetFile()``, for example::

    filename = xml.dbGetFile('stimuli/anechoic/instruments/anechoic_cello.wav');
    sig = wavread(filename);

All the data that is automatically downloaded is cached inside a temporary
folder. You can get the position of this folder by executing ``xml.dbTmp`` and
change it with ``xml.dbTmp('/path/to/tmp')``. If
you would like to clear the temporary folder you can execute ``xml.dbClearTmp``.
Before downloading a file from the remote database ``xml.dbGetFile`` first looks
if you have a file on your computer in the exact relative position as specified,
in this case ``./stimuli/anechoic/instruments/anechoic_cello.wav``, then it will
look if you have a local copy of the database on your PC. The position of that
database can be specified or seen by the ``xm.dbPath`` function. After that it
looks inside the temporary cache for the file and only then downloads it.

In the daily use of the |TwoEarsModel| you might even never directly use the
``xml.dbGetFile()`` function as you specify files to use most likely inside a
scene description file, see :ref:`sec-xml-scene-description`.  For example, in
order to use the same |HRTF| from above you have to add the following address to
your scene configuration:

.. code-block:: xml

    <scene HRIRs="impulse_responses/qu_kemar_anechoic/QU_KEMAR_anechoic_3m.sofa">

The |BinSim| will then automatically call the ``xml.dbGetFile()`` function in
order to get the desired |HRTF|.

To see further examples, you might want to look at
:ref:`sec-impulse-responses-usage`.
