Usage
=====

As explained in the :ref:`sec-tutorial-database` tutorial the database is
located at https://dev.qu.tu-berlin.de/projects/twoears-getdata, but you don't
have to download any files yourself as this is automatically performed by the
|BinSim| or by explicitly calling ``db.getFile()``, for example::

    filename = db.getFile('stimuli/anechoic/instruments/anechoic_cello.wav');
    sig = wavread(filename);

All the data that is automatically downloaded is cached inside a temporary
folder. You can get the position of this folder by executing ``db.tmp()`` and
change it with ``db.tmp('/path/to/tmp')``. If
you would like to clear the temporary folder you can execute ``db.clearTmp()``.
Before downloading a file from the remote database ``db.getFile()`` first looks
if you have a file on your computer in the exact relative position as specified,
in this case ``./stimuli/anechoic/instruments/anechoic_cello.wav``, then it will
look if you have a local copy of the database on your PC. The position of that
database can be specified or seen by the ``db.path`` function. After that it
looks inside the temporary cache for the file and only then downloads it.

If you want to get an overview what files are present in database, you may copy
the output of ``db.url()`` and paste it into your web browser. As a second, 
more Linux-like alternative you may call ``db.listDir('')`` in order to display
the content of the database's root directory. For other directories call e.g.
``db.listDir('this/is/a/directory')``. Listing the content of sub-directories
can be done by providing a second boolean argument, i.e. 
``db.listDir('this/is/a/directory', 1)``. For convenience, you can also download
the content for a whole directory with e.g. 
``db.getDir('this/is/a/directory', 1)`` with second parameter, again, specifying
if you want to download the content of potential sub-directories. However,
take care, since you might request a lot of files.

In the daily use of the |TwoEarsModel| you might even never directly use the
``db.getFile()`` function as you specify files to use most likely inside a
scene description file, see :ref:`sec-xml-scene-description`.  For example, in
order to use the same |HRTF| from above you have to add the following address to
your scene configuration:

.. code-block:: xml

    <scene HRIRs="impulse_responses/qu_kemar_anechoic/QU_KEMAR_anechoic_3m.sofa">

The |BinSim| will then automatically call the ``db.getFile()`` function in
order to get the desired |HRTF|.

To see further examples, you might want to look at
:ref:`sec-impulse-responses-usage`.
