Impulse responses
=================

The Two!Ears database provides a large collection of |HRTF|\ s and |BRIR|\ s.
Some of those were measured by the Two!Ears project, others were collected from
other labs. All of them are available in the `SOFA format`_ which allows for an
easy usage with the |BinSim|.
