Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This database contains views of the environment in the
Adream-building, a robot-lab space consisting of a large hall that
contains four small rooms without concrete windows, doors, and
ceilings (:numref:`fig-adream-building`). Impulse responses are
available for this environment in :ref:`sec-brir-twoears-adream`.

    Lab space in the Adream building, look from above.
    

The views are taken from the robot's perspective, using the calibrated
stereovision system embedded on the robot
(:numref:`fig-kemar-glasses`).

    KEMAR head with mounted stereo cameras.

Views are available with the robot in all four positions
(:numref:`fig-adream-pos-setup`) for which impulse responses of where measured
in the |BRIR| dataset :ref:`sec-brir-twoears-adream`. For positions the head
orientation ranges from -78° to 78° in 2° steps. For each position,
raw and rectified images are available from both left and right
cameras.

All raw images are available under for respective position (1-4) are available
at::

		vision/twoears_stereo_adream/raw/pos1/*
		vision/twoears_stereo_adream/raw/pos2/*
		vision/twoears_stereo_adream/raw/pos3/*
		vision/twoears_stereo_adream/raw/pos4/*
		
Rectified images were obtained from the raw images with the `stereo_image_proc
<http://wiki.ros.org/stereo_image_proc>`_ tool from |ROS|. They are
available under (same structure as raw images)::

		vision/twoears_stereo_adream/rect

The calibration data of the stereovision system includes all pairs of
images used for calibration, and text files with the estimated
parameters. This data were computed and saved by the
`camera_calibration <http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration>`_ tool
from |ROS|. It is available under::

		vision/twoears_stereo_adream/calib
