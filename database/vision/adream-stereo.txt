Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This database contains views of the environment in the
Adream-building, a robot-lab space consisting of a large hall that
contains four small rooms without concrete windows, doors, and
ceilings (:numref:`fig-adream-building`). Impulse responses are
available for this environment in :ref:`sec-brir-twoears-adream`.

    Lab space in the Adream building, look from above.
    

The views are taken from the robot's perspective, using the calibrated
stereovision system embedded on the robot
(:numref:`fig-kemar-glasses`).

    KEMAR head with mounted stereo cameras.

Views are available with the robot in all four positions used for the
impulse responses (:numref:`fig-adream-pos-setup`), with head
orientation ranging from -78° to 78° in 2° steps. For each position,
raw and rectified images are available from both left and right
cameras.

All raw images are available under::

		vision/twoears_stereo_adream/raw
		
Rectified images were obtained with the `stereo_image_proc
<http://wiki.ros.org/stereo_image_proc>`_ tool from |ROS|. They are
available under::

		vision/twoears_stereo_adream/rect

Calibration data of the stereovision system includes all pairs of
images used for calibration, and text files with the estimated
parameters. These data were computed and saved by the
`camera_calibration <http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration>`_ tool
from |ROS|. They are available under::
