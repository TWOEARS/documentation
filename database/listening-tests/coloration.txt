    Mean rated coloration of a point source synthesised with |WFS| compared to a
    reference point source. The error bars are showing the confidence intervals.

This database entry contains stimuli and results from the experiments described
in [Wierstorf2014a]_. In the experiment different |WFS| systems synthesising a
point source were rated in terms of their perceived coloration compared to a real
point source. This was done for different audio material, namely pink noise,
speech, and music and different listener positions. The different |WFS| systems
consisted always of a circular loudspeaker array with a radius of 3m, but
different number of employed loudspeakers. To control for the exact
listening position, allow instantaneous switching between listening positions,
and allow for very high numbers of loudspeakers in the |WFS| systems
the experiment was performed with binaural synthesis without head tracking.
The results are summarised in :numref:`fig-2013-05-01_wfs_coloration`.

For the music stimulus a twelve second clip from the electronic song “Luv
deluxe” by “Cinnamon Chasers” was chosen, which is not published in this
database. The applied speech and pink noise stimuli can be found under::

.. note::

    This experiment has a flaw for the results using very high number of
    loudspeakers. In this case some of the perceivable coloration was due to
    some artifacts arriving from the fact that we employed only integer delay in
    the delay line involved in the |WFS| processing. See the next experiment
    for a corrected version.

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`The first experiment <sec-2013-05-01_wfs_coloration>` investigating
coloration in |WFS| had some artefacts in the stimuli for high frequencies due
to the limitation coming with a finite sampling rate during the process of time
delaying single signals in |WFS|. This time the experiment was repeated using
fractional delay filter. In addition, we added a linear
loudspeaker array besides the circular one used in the first experiment.
