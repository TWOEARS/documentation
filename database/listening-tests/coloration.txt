2013-05-01: Coloration of a point source in Wave Field Synthesis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Mean rated coloration of a point source synthesised with |WFS| compared to a
    reference point source. The error bars are showing the confidence intervals.

This database entry contains stimuli and results from the experiments described
in [Wierstorf2014a]_. In the experiment different |WFS| systems synthesising a
point source were rated in terms of their perceived coloration compared to real
point source. This was done for different audio material, namely pink noise,
speech, and music and different listener positions. The results are summarised
in :numref:`fig-2013-05-01_wfs_coloration` and available in the following
database files::

    experiments/2013-05-01_wfs_coloration/human_label_coloration_wfs_multiple_positions_speech.csv

the corresponding stimuli are provided as |brs| files that can be used together
with the |binsim| and the corresponding scene description file
:file:`wfs_coloration.xml` to reproduce the exact pink noise signals from the
test. the path to the |brs| files is also listed in the first column of the
human label files, so it can directly extracted from them.

2015-10-01: coloration of a point source in wave field synthesis revisited
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`the first experiment <sec-2013-05-01_wfs_coloration>` investigating
coloration in |wfs| had some artefacts in the stimuli for high frequencies due
to the limitation coming with a finite sampling rate during the process of time
delaying single signals in |wfs|. this time the experiment was repeated using
fractional delay filter (add citation). in addition, we added a linear
loudspeaker array besides the circular one used in the first experiment.

    Median of the rated coloration of a point source synthesized with |WFS|
    compared to a reference point source. The error bars are showing the
    confidence intervals.

The results are available in the following files::
