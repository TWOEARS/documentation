For the following localisation experiments we provide again |BRS| files together
with the rating results. The |BRS| files can be used together with the |BinSim|
on order to have the |TwoEarsModel| in the same situation as the listener
including its ability to turn the head.

2012-03-01: Localisation of a real vs. binaural simulated point source

    The mean over all subjects together with the 95% confidence interval is
    shown. In grey, the individual subjects’ results are presented. In graph A,
    the signed error of the localization of the eleven speakers is shown. In
    graph B, the mean standard deviation for the localization task is depicted.
    The top row represents the condition with the real loudspeakers, the middle
    row the room |HRTF|\ s (|BRIR|\ s), and the bottom row the anechoic |HRTF|\ s.
    Figure from [Wierstorf2012].


In this experiment the localisation of a real point source realised by a
loudspeaker was compared to the localisation of a binaural simulation of the
same source using |HRTF|\ s or |BRIR|\ s. The results are published in
[Wierstorf2012]_. The mean localisation results are stored in the corresponding human label file
which comes together with the |BRS| files::

In addition, we provide the trajectory of the actual head movements, each
listener performed during the experiments in the folder
``experiments/2012-03-01_brs_vs_real_localisation/head_movements_real_vs_simulated_loudspeaker/``.

2013-11-01: Localisation of different source types in sound field synthesis

    Average localization results. The black symbols indicate loudspeakers, the
    grey ones the synthesised source. At every listening position, an arrow is
    pointing into the direction from which the listeners perceived the
    corresponding auditory event. The color of the arrow displays the absolute
    localization error, which is also summarised as an average beside the arrows
    for every row of positions. The average confidence interval for all
    localization results is 2.3°. Listening conditions which resulted in
    listeners saying that they perceived two sources are highlighted with a
    small 2 written below the position. Figure from [Wierstorf2014b].

In this experiment listeners localised different synthesised sources using
different sound field synthesis methods and loudspeaker setups. The experiment
is described in [Wierstorf2014b]_. Here, we are providing the |BRS| files that
were used for binaural simulations of the different systems and listener
positions during the experiment and the corresponding rating results of the
listeners.
