    The mean over all subjects together with the 95% confidence interval is
    shown. In grey, the individual subjects’ results are presented. In graph A,
    the signed error of the localization of the eleven speakers is shown. In
    graph B, the mean standard deviation for the localization task is depicted.
    The top row represents the condition with the real loudspeakers, the middle
    row the room |HRTF|\ s (|BRIR|\ s), and the bottom row the anechoic |HRTF|\ s.
    Figure from [Wierstorf2012].


In this experiment the localisation of a real point source realised by a
loudspeaker was compared to the localisation of a binaural simulation of the
same source using |HRTF|\ s or |BRIR|\ s. The results are published in
[Wierstorf2012]_.

    Average localization results. The black symbols indicate loudspeakers, the
    grey ones the synthesised source. At every listening position, an arrow is
    pointing into the direction from which the listeners perceived the
    corresponding auditory event. The color of the arrow displays the absolute
    localization error, which is also summarised as an average beside the arrows
    for every row of positions. The average confidence interval for all
    localization results is 2.3°. Listening conditions which resulted in
    listeners saying that they perceived two sources are highlighted with a
    small 2 written below the position. Figure from [Wierstorf2014b].

In this experiment different sound sources like a point source or plane wave
were synthesised using |WFS| and |NFC-HOA|. In a series of listening test
participants had to localise those sources from different listening positions in
order to investigate how well the different methods were able to provide the
correct directional impression.  In order to compare different systems and
different listening positions the experiments were performed with dynamic
binaural synthesis.  The experiment is described in [Wierstorf2014b]_.

    ``phi_error``  (direction virtual sound event) - (direction auditory event)
    ``phi_ci``     95%-confidence interval of phi
    ``std``        standard deviation of the five repetitions used to measure phi
    ``std_ci``     95%-confidence interval of std
    ``phi_offset`` offset applied to the virtual sound event [4]_
    ============== ==============================================================

.. [1]
    The offset was varied for the single conditions. Have a look at the average
    result files for the actual offset values.
.. [2]
    The participants were advised to only look into the horizontal plane.
.. [3]
    If two values are provided in the form of {2,25}, two auditory events were
    perceived at those two positions.
.. [4]
    This offset was introduced to have a jitter for the virtual sound event
    positions, enabling more randomness to the possible source positions. The
    results of ``phi`` and ``phi_error`` are already offset corrected, but not
    the directions reported in the results files for the single listeners,
    mentioned above

    Experimental settings used in this study. One target female voice and four interfering male voices are presented at the same time from 11 potential loudspeaker locations. Five masker patterns are considered as indicated by the green loudspeakers.

A recent psychophysical study [KopcoEtAl2010] has shown that listeners are able to exploit prior knowledge of the masker locations in a cocktail party scenario. This study investigated the ability of listeners to localise a female target voice in the presence of four male masking voices. In particular, it addresses two main research questions. First, we ask whether listeners are able to exploit prior information about the masker locations in Kopco et al.'s task when listening over headphones, where binaural cues are limited to those present in the HRIRs used to spatialise the signals for headphone listening. In headphone listening, head movements are not available and room characteristics can be carefully controlled; hence, we also investigate whether prior knowledge of the masker locations can assist localisation in both anechoic and reverberant conditions. Second, we ask whether the sources of knowledge available to listeners in this scenario -- speaker characteristics and masker locations --  can be successfully exploited in a computational system for sound localisation. More details can be found in [MaBrown2016].

    Effect of maskers on localisation accuracy shown as the increase in RMS error (re. the no-masker control condition) for the anechoic (left -- dry) and the reverberant (right -- reverb) sessions. RMS errors are averaged across all masker patterns and across either all target locations, across on-masker locations, or across off-masker locations. The red stars indicate conditions with significant difference (p<0.005).

    Across-participant average ($\pm$\,SEM) of the increases in RMS errors (re. the no-masker control condition) as a function of the target location. Masker locations are indicated by the filled triangles along the abscissa. Each column of panels shows the Mixed and Fixed condition data for one masker pattern (masker locations indicated by the filled triangles along the abscissa) and for the anechoic session (upper panels) and the reverberant session (lower panels).
