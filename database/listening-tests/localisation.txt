    The mean over all subjects together with the 95% confidence interval is
    shown. In grey, the individual subjects’ results are presented. In graph A,
    the signed error of the localization of the eleven speakers is shown. In
    graph B, the mean standard deviation for the localization task is depicted.
    The top row represents the condition with the real loudspeakers, the middle
    row the room |HRTF|\ s (|BRIR|\ s), and the bottom row the anechoic |HRTF|\ s.
    Figure from [Wierstorf2012].


In this experiment the localisation of a real point source realised by a
loudspeaker was compared to the localisation of a binaural simulation of the
same source using |HRTF|\ s or |BRIR|\ s. The results are published in
[Wierstorf2012]_.

    Average localization results. The black symbols indicate loudspeakers, the
    grey ones the synthesised source. At every listening position, an arrow is
    pointing into the direction from which the listeners perceived the
    corresponding auditory event. The color of the arrow displays the absolute
    localization error, which is also summarised as an average beside the arrows
    for every row of positions. The average confidence interval for all
    localization results is 2.3°. Listening conditions which resulted in
    listeners saying that they perceived two sources are highlighted with a
    small 2 written below the position. Figure from [Wierstorf2014b].

In this experiment different sound sources like a point source or plane wave
were synthesised using |WFS| and |NFC-HOA|. In a series of listening test
participants had to localise those sources from different listening positions in
order to investigate how well the different methods were able to provide the
correct directional impression.  In order to compare different systems and
different listening positions the experiments were performed with dynamic
binaural synthesis.  The experiment is described in [Wierstorf2014b]_.

The localisation results of the single listeners can be found in the following

The results are encoded as follows in the csv files:

    ================ =======================================================
    ``trial_number`` position in the experiment of the presented condition
    ``mode``         ``0`` => real single loudspeaker (for calibration);
                     otherwise number of used loudspeakers (1456 denotes
                     NFC-HOA with 14 loudspeakers, but an order of 28)
    ``source``       internal number of presented condition
    ``n``            number of head-tracker (always 1)
    ``x``            x position of listener (as reported by head-tracker)
    ``y``            y-position of listener
    ``z``            z-position of listener
    ``phi``          horizontal direction of auditory event (includes offset
                     [1]_)
    ``real_phi``     direction of virtual sound event (includes offset [1]_)
    ``delta``        median direction of auditory event [2]_
    ``stdev``        standard deviation of the listener head orientation
                     during acquisition of head-tracking data (nine samples
                     after the person presses enter)
    ``elapsed_time`` time the person needed to localize the source and press
                     enter
    ================ =======================================================

In addition, we provide the trajectory of the actual head movements, each
listener performed during the localisation experiments in the following

The average results are encoded in the following way

    ============== ==============================================================
    ``condition``  name of used BRS file
    ``X``          x-position of listener
    ``Y``          y-position of listener
    ``phi``        direction of auditory event [3]_
    ``phi_error``  (direction virtual sound event) - (direction auditory event)
    ``phi_ci``     95%-confidence interval of phi
    ``std``        standard deviation of the five repetitions used to measure phi
    ``std_ci``     95%-confidence interval of std
    ``phi_offset`` offset applied to the virtual sound event [4]_
    ============== ==============================================================

.. [1]
    The offset was varied for the single conditions. Have a look at the average
    result files for the actual offset values.
.. [2]
    The participants were advised to only look into the horizontal plane.
.. [3]
    If two values are provided in the form of {2,25}, two auditory events were
    perceived at those two positions.
.. [4]
    This offset was introduced to have a jitter for the virtual sound event
    positions, enabling more randomness to the possible source positions. The
    results of ``phi`` and ``phi_error`` are already offset corrected, but not
    the directions reported in the results files for the single listeners,
    mentioned above
