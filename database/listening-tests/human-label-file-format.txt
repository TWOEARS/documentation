Human label file format
-----------------------

The test results are called human labels in the following and the average
results of the single experiments are all stored in the same way in the human
label file format. This is a simple csv file, which includes the following
entries::

    # Description of the results stored in the file
    # stimuli, rating, 95% confidence interval
    experiments/link_to/brs_file1.wav, -0.4653, 0.0123
    experiments/link_to/brs_file2.wav,  0.2738, 0.1548
    ...

The file starts with a header that uses ``#`` as a comment sign and then
includes at least three columns. The first one provides a link to the actual
|BRS| file used in the experiment. The second one the average result from the
experiment, this could be a mean, a median, or something else, and the third one
showing the variance of the data, in most of the cases in the form of the
confidence interval. The files could of course have more columns with additional
information, like the time the listeners needed to response or if another value
like the sound pressure level was changed during the experiment it could be
indicated in a later column.

Besides the human label files, most experiments provide the anonymised results
from single listeners. The format of those data can vary, but in all cases they
are provided as plain text or csv files.
