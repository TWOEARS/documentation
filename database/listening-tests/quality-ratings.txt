    The ten different conditions of the quality test.

We did a preference test where we asked for the preferred audio quality of the
presented stimuli, see [Raake2014]_ for details. The stimuli consisted always of
the same acoustic scene with three individual sources, which had different
degrees of impairments. We provide the ratings of the listeners and the
WAV-files of the stimuli in the following folders::

    Estimated preference of the different reproduction systems
    averaged over all listeners and musical pieces. The preference was estimated
    with a Bradley-Terry-Luce model. The bars denote the corresponding 95%
    confidence interval. :download:`(PDF version)

We did a paired comparison preference test where listeners rated their listening
preference for four different pop musical pieces presented by |WFS|, stereo or
surround. The musical pieces were all mixed by the same person in order to try
to minimize the influence of the mix on the ratings, but still trying to get the
best out of every system, see [Hold2016a]_ for details.
As this experiment was performed with real loudspeakers, there are no |BRS|
files available with this experiment, but if you like to run a binaural model on
the stimuli you can try the |BRS| files from
:ref:`sec-2016-06-01_wfs_mixing_quality` which provide a anechoic binaural
simulation of the loudspeaker array setup used in this experiment.

    Estimated preferences of the different mixes of a piece of pop music for
    |WFS|. The conditions are stereo (STE), |WFS| reference (REF), both from
    :ref:`a former listening test <sec-2015-11-01_wfs_stereo_comparison>`, |WFS|
    with mixing parameter switched off (MM), |WFS| with decreased processing of
    the specified mixing parameter (M), |WFS| with increased processing (P), and
    |WFS| with further increased processing (PP). The preference was estimated
    with a Bradley-Terry-Luce model. The bars denote the corresponding 95%
    confidence interval. :download:`(PDF version)

We did a paired comparison preference test where listeners rated their listening
preference for a pop musical pieces presented by |WFS| or stereo. For |WFS| four
to five different mixes of the same song were presented for one run of the
experiment. Those mixes were variations along one of the following mixing
parameters: "compression", "equalizing", "reverb", "changes of reverb,
equalizing and compression to the vocals alone", "positioning of musical
foreground elements".  The musical pieces were all mixed by the same person,
that also mixed the stereo and |WFS| reference condition, compare [Hold2016a]_.
The results for the "positioning of musical foreground elements" are discussed
in more detail in [Hold2016b]_.

The experiment was performed with dynamic binaural synthesis. The |BRS| files
for the 56-channel circular loudspeaker array are available under::

    experiments/2016-06-01_wfs_mixing_quality/brs/

The actual stimuli for the different mixing conditions are available as wav
file, containing the driving signals for the loudspeakers. The stereo file is
available as a two channel signal, the |WFS| signals are stored in a 64-channel
wav file, where the first 56 channel are the driving signals for the
loudspeakers::

The single preference ratings of the 41 test participants and the results of the
survey conducted after the experiment are available under::
