    The ten different conditions of the quality test.

We did a preference test where we asked for the preferred audio quality of the
presented stimuli, see [Raake2014]_ for details. The stimuli consisted always of
the same acoustic scene with three individual sources, which had different
degrees of impairments. We provide the ratings of the listeners and the
WAV-files of the stimuli in the following folders::

2015-11-01: Listening preference of popular music presented by |WFS|, surround, and stereo

    Estimated preference (system ability) of the different reproduction systems
    averaged over all listeners and musical pieces. The preference was estimated
    with a Bradley-Terry-Luce model. The bars denote the corresponding 95%
    confidence interval.

We did a paired comparison preference test where listeners rated their listening
preference for four different pop musical pieces presented by |WFS|, stereo or
surround. The musical pieces were all mixed by the same person in order to try
to minimize the influence of the mix on the ratings, but still trying to get the
best out of every system, see [Hold2016a]_ for details. We provide the single
and average results, the |BRS| files for a binaural simulation of the
loudspeaker array (the experiment itself was performed using a real loudspeaker
array, but for modelling purposes the binaural simulation is of interest) and
the driving signals of the single loudspeakers as WAV-files

    Number of chosen preferred positons summed over all listeners and recording
    techniques. On the left side the results without visual feedback and on the
    right with visual feedback about the actual listening position are shown.

We conducted an experiment on the preferred listening position in a 5.0 surround
setup. The experiment was performed in the studio like room Calypso in the
Telefunken building of the TU Berlin. The experiment employed dynamic binaural
synthesis in order to allow instantaneous switching between positions during
listening. To accomplish this |BRIR|\ s were recorded before at nine different
positions, see :ref:`sec-brir-qu-calypso-surround`.  26 test participants rated
their preferred listening position out of the 9 positions for every recording
technique. They did this first without visual feedback using a |GUI| that only
showed nine buttons where the stimuli were randomly assigned to. In a second run
they had a |GUI| showing a actual sketch of the listening setup, similar to the
sketch shown in :numref:`tab-brir-qu-calypso-surround`.

.. note::
    The |BRIR|\ s used in this experiment were not the one available under
    `10.5281/zenodo.160761 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.160761>`_, but an
    earlier version available under `10.5281/zenodo.49691
    <http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.49691>`_.  That earlier version had an error
    in the metadata of the stored SOFA files, resulting in the fact that the
    listeners were not looking towards the front at all listening positions, but
    facing always towards the center loudspeaker.

As music material seven different simultaneously recordings of the piece
"Maurerische Trauermusik K.477" of W. A. Mozart were used. The recordings
differed in the applied recording technique, which are listed in
:numref:`tab-2016-03-01_sweet_spot` and were done at ORF (Austrian Broadcast,
Vienna) and the piece was played by the Radio Symphony Orchestra Vienna. For
more details on the applied microphones and for downloading all recordings have
a look at [Wittek2015]_.

:numref:`fig-2016-03-01_sweet_spot` summarizes the results across all listeners
and recording techniques, showing only differences between with and without
visual feedback. The results for the different recording techniques are
summarized in this :download:`PDF <../pdf/2016-03-01_sweet_spot_single.pdf>`.
For more details on the experiment have a look at [Schultze2016]_.
