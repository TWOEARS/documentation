    The ten different conditions of the quality test.

We did a preference test where we asked for the preferred audio quality of the
presented stimuli, see [Raake2014]_ for details. The stimuli consisted always of
the same acoustic scene with three individual sources, which had different
degrees of impairments. We provide the ratings of the listeners and the
WAV-files of the stimuli in the following folders::

2015-11-01: Listening preference of popular music presented by |WFS|, surround, and stereo

    Estimated preference (system ability) of the different reproduction systems
    averaged over all listeners and musical pieces. The preference was estimated
    with a Bradley-Terry-Luce model. The bars denote the corresponding 95%
    confidence interval.

We did a paired comparison preference test where listeners rated their listening
preference for four different pop musical pieces presented by |WFS|, stereo or
surround. The musical pieces were all mixed by the same person in order to try
to minimize the influence of the mix on the ratings, but still trying to get the
best out of every system, see [Hold2016a]_ for details. We provide the single
and average results, the |BRS| files for a binaural simulation of the
loudspeaker array (the experiment itself was performed using a real loudspeaker
array, but for modelling purposes the binaural simulation is of interest) and
the driving signals of the single loudspeakers as WAV-files
