IEEE AASP Challenge on Detection and Classification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This data set includes stereo recordings of acoustic environmental scenes as
well as isolated events (of an office environment). It can be used for
classification tasks of acoustic scenes and events.

We have put the isolated sounds into a folder structure processable for the
:ref:`sec-identification-training`, removed the printer class, as it was not
very suited for the training, and added a "void" class with different kinds of
noise (to be used as negative examples during training).

Usage
^^^^^

To use the data base for acoustic event classification, stereo WAV files from the
following folders are of interest::

    alert/
    clearthroat/
    cough/
    doorslam/
    drawer/
    keyboard/
    keys/
    knock/
    laughter/
    mouse/
    pageturn/
    pendrop/
    phone/
    speech/
    switch/
    void/

In each folder different recordings of the corresponding class are
provided along with an annotation file with on- and offset times.

In the ``scenes/`` folder stereo recordings of the following acoustic scenes are
provided:

    | bus
    | busystreet (busy street with heavy traffic)
    | office
    | openairmarket (open-air or semi-open market)
    | park
    | quietstreet (quiet street with mild traffic)
    | restaurant
    | supermarket
    | tube (train in the Transport for London, Underground and Overground, train
    |   networks)
    | tubestation (tube station in the Transport for London, Underground and
    |   Overground, train networks, either subterranean or supraterranean)

Each class contains ten recordings. Each recording is 30 s long. Files are named
according to the class name, i.e. ``classXX.wav`` where ``XX`` is a two-digit,
non-consecutive number.
