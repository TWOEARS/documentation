Sound databases
===============

This is a collection of different sound databases. A sound database can be
anything that comes as a collection of related sound files like a speech corpus.

Speech databases

.. _sec-grid-corpus:

GRID corpus
~~~~~~~~~~~

GRID is a large multi-talker audiovisual sentence corpus to support joint
computational-behavioural studies in speech perception. In brief, the corpus
consists of high-quality audio and video (facial) recordings of 1000 sentences
spoken by each of 34 talkers (18 male, 16 female). Sentences are of the form::

    put red at G9 now

The database provided here is a subset of the original database containing 360
randomly selected sentences for each speaker. More details about GRID can be
found on the `GRID website`_ or in the corresponding `GRID paper`_.

The GRID corpus, together with transcriptions, is freely available for research
use.

Usage
^^^^^

Each speaker comes with separate folder containing 360 sentences::

    sound_databases/grid_subset/s1/bbaf2n.wav
    ...
    sound_databases/grid_subset/s1/swwv9a.wav
    sound_databases/grid_subset/s2/bbaf1n.wav
    ...
    sound_databases/grid_subset/s34/swws3n.wav

All available files are listed in::

    sound_databases/grid_subset/flist.txt

Acoustic scenes and events
--------------------------

.. _sec-ieee-aasp:

IEEE AASP Challenge on Detection and Classification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This data set includes stereo recordings of acoustic environmental scenes as well as isolated events (of an office environment). It can
be used for classification tasks of acoustic scenes and events.

We have put the isolated sounds into a folder structure processable for the :ref:`sec-idTrainPipeline`, removed the printer class, as it was not very suited for the training, and added a "void" class with different kinds of noise (to be used as negative examples during training).

Usage
^^^^^

To use the data base for acoustic event classification, stereo WAV files from the
following folders are of interest::

    alert/
    clearthroat/
    cough/
    doorslam/
    drawer/
    keyboard/
    keys/
    knock/
    laughter/
    mouse/
    pageturn/
    pendrop/
    phone/
    speech/
    switch/
    void/

In each folder different recordings of the corresponding class are
provided along with an annotation file with on- and offset times.

In the ``scenes/`` folder stereo recordings of the following acoustic scenes are
provided:

    | bus
    | busystreet (busy street with heavy traffic)
    | office
    | openairmarket (open-air or semi-open market)
    | park
    | quietstreet (quiet street with mild traffic)
    | restaurant
    | supermarket
    | tube (train in the Transport for London, Underground and Overground, train
    |   networks)
    | tubestation (tube station in the Transport for London, Underground and
    |   Overground, train networks, either subterranean or supraterranean)

Each class contains ten recordings. Each recording is 30 s long. Files are named
according to the class name, i.e. ``classXX.wav`` where ``XX`` is a two-digit,
non-consecutive number.
