Control the rotation of a KEMAR motorized head from Matlab

The example below shows a simple position control of a :ref:`motorized KEMAR
head <sec-robot-head-motorization>` from MATLAB, using the |matlab-genomix|
bridge (see :ref:`sec-robot-install`). First, run the following commands on the
computer connected to the motor controller:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ roscore &
   $ genomixd &
   $ kemar-ros

Then in Matlab, you can try the following commands to control the rotation of
the head:

.. code-block:: matlab

   % Make sure that matlab-genomix installation directory is in your userpath
   >> userpath('<prefix>/lib/matlab');

   % Connect to genomix and load the kemar component
   >> client = genomix.client('host-machine:8080');
   >> kemar = client.load('kemar');

   % Execute the homing procedure
   >> kemar.Homing();

   % Set the reference velocity for position control to 50 deg/s
   >> kemar.SetVelocity(50);

   % Move the head to 45 deg with a blocking call
   >> kemar.MoveAbsolutePosition(45);
   % The prompt returns once the head has reached the position

   % Move the head to -30 deg with a non-blocking call
   >> r = kemar.MoveAbsolutePosition('-a', -30);
   % The prompt returns immediately. While the head moves, r.status is 'sent'.
   % When the goal is reached, r.status becomes 'done'.
