reStructuredText guidelines
---------------------------

.. contents::
    :depth: 1
    :local:

These guidelines regulate the format of our reST (reStructuredText)
documentation and provide tips for writing them:

* In section titles, capitalise only initial words and proper nouns.
* Wrap the documentation at 80 characters wide, unless a code example
  is significantly less readable when split over two lines, or for another
  good reason.
* The order of headings is the following::

      =======
      Section
      =======

      Subsection
      ----------

      Subsubsection
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Paragraphs
      ^^^^^^^^^^

* The main thing to keep in mind as you write and edit docs is that the
  more semantic markup you can add the better. So::

      To remove ``README.md`` execute ``rm README.md``...

  Isn't nearly as helpful as::

      To remove :file:`README.md` execute :command:`rm README.md`...

  This is because Sphinx will generate proper links for the latter, which
  greatly helps readers. There's basically no limit to the amount of
  useful markup you can add.
* The file ending of the reST files should be ``*.txt`` instead of ``*.rst``
  this will force github to display them as raw text files. The downside is that
  you have to tell your editor that you are editing a reST file -- ``:setf rst``
  in vim.

Add a figure
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A figure should always start with a label that can be later used to reference to
the figure. This label should always start with ``fig-``.
After that the figure with the actual image file is added. The image
should be provided as a ``png``-file and stored in a ``img/`` folder::

    .. _fig-super-result:

    .. figure:: img/super-results.png
        :align: center

        Figure caption explaining the results.

    Text in which the :numref:`fig-super-result` is referenced in.

Add a table
~~~~~~~~~~~

Like a figure a table should always start with a label for referencing and gets
a caption before the actual table::

    .. _tab-super-result:

    .. table:: Caption of the super result table.

        =============== =============== ===============
        Column1 heading Column2 heading Column3 heading
        =============== =============== ===============
        1               2               3
        1               2               3
        1               2               3
        =============== =============== ===============

    Text in which the Table :ref:`tab-super-result` is referenced in.

There is another way to define the same table::

    .. _tab-super-result:

    .. table:: Caption of the super result table.

        +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
        | Column1 heading | Column2 heading | Column3 heading |
        +=================+=================+=================+
        | 1               | 2               | 3               |
        +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
        | 1               | 2               | 3               |
        +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
        | 1               | 2               | 3               |
        +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+

This is especially interesting for more complex tables.

Line breaking is unfortunately not handled automatically in a table. Instead,
the table will be stretched out to fir the content in one line per cell. You can
add line breaks manually by inserting blank lines::

    .. _tab-super-result:

    .. table:: Caption of the super result table.

        +-----------------+-----------------+--------------------+
        | Column1 heading | Column2 heading | Column3 heading    |
        +=================+=================+====================+
        | 1               | 2               | text in line1      |
        |                 |                 | more text in line1 |
        |                 |                 |                    |
        |                 |                 | text in line2      |
        |                 |                 |                    |
        |                 |                 | text in line 3     |
        +-----------------+-----------------+--------------------+
        | 1               | 2               | 3                  |
        +-----------------+-----------------+--------------------+
        | 1               | 2               | 3                  |
        +-----------------+-----------------+--------------------+

This will result in

.. _tab-super-result:

.. table:: Caption of the super result table.

    +-----------------+-----------------+--------------------+
    | Column1 heading | Column2 heading | Column3 heading    |
    +=================+=================+====================+
    | 1               | 2               | text in line1      |
    |                 |                 | more text in line1 |
    |                 |                 |                    |
    |                 |                 | text in line2      |
    |                 |                 |                    |
    |                 |                 | text in line 3     |
    +-----------------+-----------------+--------------------+
    | 1               | 2               | 3                  |
    +-----------------+-----------------+--------------------+
    | 1               | 2               | 3                  |
    +-----------------+-----------------+--------------------+


Dealing with referencing throughout the document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to add a reference to another section, figure, or table you can do
it the following way::

    See results in :numref:`fig-super-result` in Section :ref:`sec-results`.

This requires of course that the labels for the figure and the section is set
accordingly::

    .. _sec-results

    Results
    -------

    .. _fig-super-results

    .. figure:: img/results.png

    Super results from the experiment.

If you do the referencing as shown in the first code listing the
``:ref:`label``` will be replaced by the title of the section or ``Fig.`` and
the number of the figure.

.. _sec-acronyms:

Using acronyms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an acronym like HRTF, you should define it in the :file:`acronym.py`
file in the following way::

    .. |HRTF| replace:: :abbr:`HRTF (head-related transfer function)`

In the text you then simply write ``|HRTF|``.  This will transform to acronym
like |HRTF| in the HTML version and will be written out only the first time in
the PDF version of the documentation. If you need the plural form you have to
write ``|HRTF|\ s`` which will translate into |HRTF|\ s.
