Get started with Sphinx
-----------------------

Two!Ears' documentation uses the Sphinx_ documentation system, which in turn
is based on docutils_. The basic idea is that lightly-formatted plain-text
documentation is transformed into HTML, PDF, and any other output format.

To actually build the documentation locally, you'll currently need to install
Sphinx -- ``pip install Sphinx`` or ``sudo apt-get install python-sphinx`` should
do the trick.
Under Windows you first have to install python, which should also install pip
and you can install Sphinx then also via pip. Otherwise have a look at the
`official installation guide`_.

.. caution::

    We need sphinx version 1.3 or later in order to use the setting of line
    number start value for code blocks. It could be that you have to use pip to
    get this version.

Then, building the HTML is easy; just run:

.. code-block:: bash

    make html-preview

or directly ``sphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees . _build/html-preview`` if
``make`` is not working for you. The result can be explored under
:file:`_build/html-preview/index.html`.

.. note::

    To generate the version presented on the `official Two!Ears documentation site
    <http://docs.twoears.eu>`_ you have to run ``make html``. As the
    documentation is hosted and automatically build by `Read the Docs`_ you
    don't need to do this.

To get started contributing, you'll want to read the `reStructuredText
Primer`_. After that, you'll want to read about the `Sphinx-specific markup`_
that's used to manage meta data, indexing, and cross-references.
A very detailed documentation is provided at the `Sphinx/Rest Memo site`_.
