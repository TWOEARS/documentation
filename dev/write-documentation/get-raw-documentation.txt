Though Two!Ears' documentation is intended to be read as HTML or PDF at
http://docs.twoears.eu, we edit it as a collection of text files for maximum
flexibility. These files live in the 
`Two!Ears documentation repository <https://github.com/TWOEARS/documentation>`_.

If you'd like to start contributing to our docs, clone this repository and get
started:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/documentation.git
