Introduction
------------

This document gives coding conventions for Matlab code as part of the Two!Ears
Auditory Model.

Code is read much more often than it is written. The guidelines provided here
are intended to improve the **readability** of code and make it **consistent** across
the whole Two!Ears Auditory Model. Both points are, besides a good documentation, also
a big part of the impression our software gives to other users.

These guidelines are introduced at a stage where we have already written code
and you are of course not forced to rewrite the existing code. For your existing
code the following points should be considered:

* Make sure your old code includes a function/class header for documentation
* If you have to read code that you have not written yourself and which does not
  comply to the guidelines presented here, you could create an issue if you are
  not able to understand the code
