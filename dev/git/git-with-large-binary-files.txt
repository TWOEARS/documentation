Git with large binary files
---------------------------

Git was not developed for tracking and storing large binary files. With `Git
Large File Storage <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`_ there exists a solution
directly using github for handling large files, but its free version is
limited to a certain amount of data. It can also be used with our own servers,
but requires a special software running on the server.

In order to avoid this we use a solution that only needs special software on the
client side, see `Git-Media <https://github.com/TWOEARS/git-media>`_. This you
need in order to work with our `internal database
<https://dev.qu.tu-berlin.de/projects/twoears-database-internal>`_.
