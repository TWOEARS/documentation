Git under Windows

* Apart from the git installation on Windows, I recommend `TortoiseGit`_ for a nice
  user interface.

  * it has to be configured to use the below mentioned `git for windows`_ as
    back-end (usually should be configured like that by default): you can check in
    ``(right-click in Explorer)->TortoiseGit/Settings/General/Git for Windows``.
    (Click the ``version -> Check now`` button to ensure it says at least ``git
    version 1.9.2.msysgit.0``.

* If you want to use the Git bash, you need to
  install the newest `git for windows`_.

  * with a right-click on a folder, you can then start the git bash from that
    point
