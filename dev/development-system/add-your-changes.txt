Add your changes
----------------

If you did some modifications to the code from a repository and you would like to
add your changes you should always push them as a new branch and create a pull
request in order to notify others about your changes and their goal.
See the `help on pull requests
<https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_ for an introduction on
how to do this.

For a more detailed discussion on how to use git to incorporate your changes,
have a look at the next section :ref:`sec-git`.
