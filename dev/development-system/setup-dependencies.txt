Set up dependencies on particular branches

Git allows to ease software development by using :ref:`branches
<sec-git-branches>`. During the development of the whole model it could happen
that you have dependencies to particular branches of other modules. You can
specify those dependencies also in the XML configuration files, for example:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <!-- Configure which parts of the Two!Ears model should be started -->

    <requirements>
        <TwoEarsPart branch="master"
                     sub="src"
                     startup="startBinauralSimulator">binaural-simulator</TwoEarsPart>
        <TwoEarsPart branch="feature1"
                     sub="API_MO"
                     startup="SOFAstart">sofa</TwoEarsPart>
        <TwoEarsPart branch="feature1"
                     startup="startAuditoryFrontEnd">auditory-front-end</TwoEarsPart>
        <TwoEarsPart branch="master"
                     startup="startBlackboardSystem">blackboard-system</TwoEarsPart>
    </requirements>

The ``startTwoEars`` function will then check if you have all the modules
checked out at the correct branches. Of course you have to have git installed in
order to use this feature.  Even if you are using only the master branches you
are encouraged to use the ``branch`` setting as it ensures that other people
testing your code are also using the master branch and not another one.

.. note::

    Under Windows it is most likely that Matlab complains that git cannot be
    found in the system path, when executing ``startTwoEars``. To fix this you
    have to add git to your system paths, see for example `this tutorial
    <http://blog.countableset.ch/2012/06/07/adding-git-to-windows-7-path/>`_.

The ``startup`` entries are functions that are looked for in the Matlab path and
executed by ``startTwoEars``. If you want to include not only a folder, but also
all of it sub-folders to the path you can replace ``sub`` by ``sub-all``.
