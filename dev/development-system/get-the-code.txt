The development of the |TwoEarsModel| happens independently for its different
:ref:`modules <sec-modules>`. All of them are hosted as git repositories on
github. For an overview go to https://github.com/TWOEARS.

In order to get started you should :ref:`familarize yourself with git <sec-git>`
and then start to clone the repository you would like to change the code.  First
you have to start with getting the `main repository`_ as all other modules need
this as a basis:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/main.git

.. warning::

    At github you will also find a repository that is used for the official
    releases of the model (https://github.com/TWOEARS/TwoEars). Please **don't**
    use this for development.

Work with the whole Two!Ears model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us now assume you want to take part in the development of the complete
|TwoEarsModel|. What you have to do then is the following. In the `main
repository`_ you will find the file :file:`TwoEars.xml` which defines all
modules that are part of the |TwoEarsModel|:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <!-- Configure which parts of the Two!Ears model should be started -->

    <requirements>
        <TwoEarsPart sub="src"    startup="startBinauralSimulator">binaural-simulator</TwoEarsPart>
        <TwoEarsPart sub="API_MO" startup="SOFAstart">sofa</TwoEarsPart>
        <TwoEarsPart              startup="startAuditoryFrontEnd">auditory-front-end</TwoEarsPart>
        <TwoEarsPart              startup="startBlackboardSystem">blackboard-system</TwoEarsPart>
    </requirements>

First clone all necessary repositories:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir git
    $ mkdir git/twoears/
    $ cd git/twoears
    $ git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/main.git # if not already done
    $ git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/binaural-simulator.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/SOFA.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/auditory-front-end.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/blackboard-system.git

Then you have to define the paths of the single modules. In the `main
repository`_ copy the file :file:`TwoEarsPaths_Example.xml` to
:file:`TwoEarsPaths.xml` and adjust it to the used paths, in our case the
default settings:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <!-- Configuration file for the Two!Ears auditory model -->

    <repoPaths>
        <!-- https://github.com/TWOEARS/binaural-simulator -->
        <binaural-simulator>~/git/twoears/binaural-simulator</binaural-simulator>
        <!-- https://github.com/TWOEARS/auditory-front-end -->
        <auditory-front-end>~/git/twoears/auditory-front-end</auditory-front-end>
        <!-- https://github.com/TWOEARS/blackboard-system -->
        <blackboard-system>~/git/twoears/blackboard-system</blackboard-system>
        <!-- https://github.com/TWOEARS/SOFA -->
        <sofa>~/git/twoears/SOFA</sofa>
    </repoPaths>

After that you can simply run the following command in the folder of the `main
repository`_ in order to work with the whole model:

.. code-block:: Matlab

    >> startTwoEars;

Work with a single module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to work only on a single module you need only to get its
repository as well as all its dependencies. If you not sure what are the
dependencies, you can have a look at its XML configuration file.  For example,
in the case of the |BinSim| it is stored in the file
:file:`BinauralSimulator.xml` in its main directory of the `binaural-simulator
repository`_:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <!-- Configure dependency of Two!Ears modules for the Binaural Simulator -->

    <!-- Start the Two!Ears Binaural Simulator with
         startTwoEars('BinauralSimulator.xml'); -->

    <requirements>
      <TwoEarsPart  sub="src"
                    startup="startBinauralSimulator">binaural-simulator</TwoEarsPart>
      <TwoEarsPart  sub="API_MO"
                    startup="SOFAstart">sofa</TwoEarsPart>
    </requirements>

This means in this case you have to clone the `sofa repository`_ in order to use
the |BinSim|:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir git
    $ mkdir git/twoears
    $ cd git/twoears
    $ git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/main.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/SOFA.git

After that you can start the |BinSim| in Matlab with the following command in
order to test it::

    >> startTwoEars('BinauralSimulator.xml');

.. _main repository: https://github.com/TWOEARS/main
.. _sofa repository: https://github.com/TWOEARS/SOFA
.. _binaural-simulator repository: https://github.com/TWOEARS/binaural-simulator
