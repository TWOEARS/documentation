The |BinSim| enables the creation of binaural audio signals for different
situations. This is done via the usage of |HRTF|\ s or |BRIR|\ s, which are
provided in the |database|. All the needed data will be downloaded on demand
from the data repository via a http connection.  The next sections will help you
to get started with the |BinSim| by defining and simulating your own acoustic
scenes with it.

For all its calculations the |BinSim| uses the signal processing core of the
`SoundScape Renderer`_ which is written in C++ and provided via a MEX-file to
Matlab. If you have problems with the provided MEX-files, see the
:ref:`sec-binsim-install` for how to compile them yourself.  If you have trouble
during the installation, don't hesitate to write a mail to the
|TwoearsMailingList|.
