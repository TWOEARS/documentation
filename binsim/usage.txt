Usage
=====

This instruction guides you in detail on how to use the |BinSim|, for a brief
guide have a look at the tutorial :ref:`sec-tutorial-acoustic-scene`. For
instructions on how to use the whole |TwoEarsModel| have a look at the provided
:ref:`sec-examples`.

In the following it is assumed that you have started the |TwoEarsModel| already
via the :code:`startTwoEars()` command, see also the :ref:`sec-install`.

Configuration
-------------

There are basically two ways for controlling and configuring the |BinSim|.
In both cases you will need audio files to create your acoustic scenes with it.
You could of course use your own audio files, but you can also use files from
the large |database|. In that case you only have to specify the
path of the desired files in the database and the |BinSim|
will download them during processing. For further information on that have a
look at the :ref:`sec-tutorial-database`.

.. _sec-matlab-scene-description:

Configuration using a Matlab script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |BinSim| uses the object-oriented programming
architecture of Matlab. In order to initialise the simulation tool, an Object
of the ``SimulatorConvexRoom()``-class has to be instantiated by:

.. code-block:: Matlab

    >> sim = simulator.SimulatorConvexRoom();

Note that the constructor returns a handle, which is the pendant to a reference
of an object in other programming language. Assigning ``sim`` to a another
variable does not copy the object. The simulation framework is depending on
a simulation kernel written in C++/MEX. It is not recommended to instantiate
more than one object of the ``SimulatorConvexRoom()``-class by calling the
constructor multiple times, since all objects would access the same simulation
kernel. To see all configurable parameters of the simulator call the object's
name in Matlab::

    >> sim

    sim =

      SimulatorConvexRoom with properties:

                    BlockSize: 4096
                   SampleRate: 44100
              NumberOfThreads: 1
                     Renderer: @ssr_binaural
                  HRIRDataset: [1x1 simulator.DirectionalIR]
                 MaximumDelay: 0.0500
                     PreDelay: 0
           LengthOfSimulation: 5
                      Sources: {[1x1 simulator.source.Point]  [1x1 simulator.source.Point]}
                        Sinks: [1x1 simulator.AudioSink]
                        Walls: []
        ReverberationRoomType: 'shoebox'
        ReverberationMaxOrder: 0

For a more detailed description of each parameter refer to the
`documentation in the source code`_. In order to change
various processing parameters of the simulator the build-in set/get
functionality of Matlab should be used, e.g.

.. code-block:: Matlab
    :linenos:

    % some processing parameters
    set(sim, ...
      'BlockSize', 4096, ...
      'SampleRate', 44100, ...
      'MaximumDelay', 0.05, ...
      'PreDelay', 0.0, ...
      'LengthOfSimulation', 5.0, ...
      'Renderer', @ssr_binaural, ...
      'HRIRDataset', simulator.DirectionalIR( ...
        'impulse_responses/qu_kemar_anechoic/QU_KEMAR_anechoic_3m.sofa') ...
      );

Line 3 and 4 set the sample rate of the simulator to 44.1 kHz and defines a
block size of 4096 samples. To define the acoustic scene, add the sound
sources and the listener.

.. code-block:: Matlab
    :linenos:

    % acoustic scene
    set(sim, ...
      'Sources', {simulator.source.Point(), simulator.source.Point()}, ...
      'Sinks', simulator.AudioSink(2) ...
      );

Sound sources are stored in a cell array. Line 3 defines two point sources, that
are created by calling the constructor of the ``simulator.source.Point``-class.
For the binaural simulation the parameter ``Sinks`` must contain only one object
of the ``simulator.AudioSink``-class describing the listener (Line 4). The
argument ``2`` in the constructor's call defines the number of input channel of
the sink, which is 2 for binaural signals. Since sources and sinks are also
handles, they can be accessed using the same set/get procedure as for the
simulator object, e.g.

.. code-block:: Matlab
    :linenos:

    % set parameters of audio sources
    set(sim.Sources{1}, ...
      'AudioBuffer', simulator.buffer.FIFO(1), ...
      'Position', [1; 2; 1.75], ...
      'Name', 'Cello', ...
      'Volume', 0.4 ...
      );

    set(sim.Sources{2}, ...
      'AudioBuffer', simulator.buffer.FIFO(1), ...
      'Position', [1; -2; 1.75], ...
      'Name', 'Castanets' ...
      );

    % set parameters of head
    set(sim.Sinks, ...
      'Position' , [0; 0; 1.75], ...
      'UnitX', [1; 0; 0], ...
      'UnitZ', [0; 0; 1], ...
      'Name', 'Head' ...
      );

``Name`` defines an unique identifier for the scene object, which
should not be re-used for any other scene object. ``Position``
defines the position of the scene object in 3D Cartesian coordinates (measured
in meter). In order to emit sound from sound sources, audio buffers have to be
respectively defined containing the sources' audio signals. A single-channel
|FIFO|-Buffer can be defined by ``simulator.buffer.FIFO(1)``.
For more details about possible buffer types please refer to the
`documentation in the source code of the buffers`_. To load sound files into the
buffers execute

.. code-block:: Matlab
    :linenos:

    % set audio input of buffers
    set(sim.Sources{1}.AudioBuffer, ...
      'File', 'stimuli/anechoic/instruments/anechoic_cello.wav');

    set(sim.Sources{2}.AudioBuffer, ...
      'File', 'stimuli/anechoic/instruments/anechoic_castanets.wav');

Configuration using XML Scene Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In following the configuration as defined above :ref:`using a Matlab script
<sec-matlab-scene-description>` is done calling the constructor of the simulator
object with an extra argument defining the file name of a XML scene description
file.

.. code-block:: Matlab

    >> sim = simulator.SimulatorConvexRoom('test_binaural.xml');

The content of :file:`test_binaural.xml` is shown below.

            UnitZ="0 0 1"
            Name="Head"/>
    </scene>

Simulate Ear-Signals
--------------------

After setting up all parameters the simulator object is ready to simulate ear
signals according to the defined acoustic scene. In order to load all parameters
into the simulation kernel execute

.. code-block:: Matlab

    >> sim.set('Init',true);

Note, that all the processing parameters and objects' initial positions have to
be defined **before** initialisation in order to initialise the simulation properly.
After the simulator has been initialised it is not possible to re-assign any
property of the simulator object. Hence the number of acoustic sources cannot be
changed within one simulation run. However, modifying e.g. the position of a
scene object is possible. The following loop calculates the ear signals until
the acoustic scene is finished.

.. code-block:: Matlab
    :linenos:

    while ~sim.isFinished()
      sim.set('Refresh',true);  % refresh all objects
      sim.set('Process',true);
    end

The function ``sim.isFinished()`` yields true if the buffers of all sound
sources are empty or if ``sim.LengthOfSimulation`` has been reached. Note, that
the simulator is a block-wise processor: Each call of line 3 generates a block
of ear signals whose length is defined by ``sim.BlockSize``. Between two
processing steps, the properties of scene objects may be manipulated, e.g. the
position of a scene object is changed. If necessary, call line 2 once before
processing a new block in order to send any modification to the simulation
kernel. The ear signals are stored in the |FIFO| buffer of the ``sim.Sinks``
object.

.. code-block:: Matlab
    :linenos:

    % read whole data from buffer
    data = sim.Sinks.getData();
    % save date into file
    sim.Sinks.saveFile('out_binaural.wav',sim.SampleRate);

In order to access or store the data line 2 or 4 may be used respectively. To
finish the simulation shut down and clean up the simulator by calling:

.. code-block:: Matlab

    >> sim.set('ShutDown',true);

The simulator reverts to an uninitialised state, where the manipulation of every
parameter is possible, again. This is necessary, if you want to start a new
simulation with complete different parameters like e.g. different number of
sound sources. If you want to start a new simulation with same parameters as
before a kind of a weak shut down should do the job:

.. code-block:: Matlab

    >> sim.set('ReInit',true);

Again, objects' initial positions have to be defined **before** re-initialisation
in order to initialise the simulation properly. The simulator however remains in
an initialised state.
