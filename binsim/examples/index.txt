These examples are use cases of the |BinSim|. They apply the configuration
directly in Matlab. For larger setups it might be easier to use the
:ref:`sec-xml-scene-description`, which will also be used in the overall
:ref:`sec-examples` where the complete model is demonstrated. If you want to
execute or modify them have a look into the ``examples/`` folder of the
|BinSim|.
