.. _sec-binsim-install:

Advanced installation
=====================

This instructions guides you how to install the |BinSim| if the mex-files
provided by the official download package are not working on your PC. This means
you have to compile them yourself.

Linux/Mac
---------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First you have to ensure some prerequisites:

* Debian or Debian-based Linux operating system (e.g. Ubuntu) recommended
* Matlab + mex-compiler
* packages (install with apt-get, aptitude, synaptic, macports, ...)

  * **make**
  * **g++** (at least version 4.7.3)
  * **libsndfile1-dev**
  * **libxml2-dev**
  * **libfftw3-dev**

* get SoundScape Renderer (location will be denoted as ``SSR_DIR``)
  ::

      git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/twoears-ssr.git SSR_DIR
      git checkout origin/master -b master

Compile MEX Binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* switch to directory containing the mex-files
  ::

      cd SSR_DIR/mex/

* if you are using a Mac and installed Matlab at ``/Applications/Matlab_R2013a.app``
  ::

      export PATH="/Applications/Matlab_R2013a.app/bin:$PATH"
      export CPPFLAGS="-I/Applications/Matlab_R2013a.app/extern/include"

* generate mex-files
  ::

      make matlab

* If you get an error saying that the version of ``GLIBCXX`` is not correct this
  is due to the usage of the Matlab provided ``libstdc++`` which is for an older
  gcc version. You can solve this by deleting linking it to your system
  ``libstdc++`` via
  ::

      ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.<LIBSTDC-VERSION> \
            /usr/local/Matlab/Matlab-VERSION/bin/glnxa64/libstdc++.so.6

* open Matlab and add ``SSR_DIR/mex/`` to Matlab-path using ``pathtool`` or ``addpath``

That's all, now you should be able to :doc:`use the Two!Ears Binaural Simulator <usage>`.

.. _sec-binsim-install-win64:

Windows 7 64bit
---------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First you have to ensure some prerequisites:

* get SoundScape Renderer (location will be denoted as ``SSR_DIR``)
  ::

      git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/twoears-ssr.git SSR_DIR
      git checkout origin/win64 -b win64

* add ``SSR_DIR\3rdparty\win64\bin`` to ``PATH`` environment variable (`HOWTO`_)

* get `MinGW 64bit`_, location will be denoted as ``MINGW_DIR``
* get `MSYS`_, location will be denoted as ``MSYS_DIR``

Compile MEX Binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* edit ``SSR_DIR/mex/win64/Makefile`` and set the ``MatlabROOT`` to the location of your systems Matlab
* edit or create ``MSYS_DIR\etc\fstab`` and add mounts for ``MINGW_DIR`` and ``SSR_DIR``
  ::

      MINGW_DIR    /mingw
      SSR_DIR      /ssr

* start the shell by executing ``MSYS_DIR/msys.bat``
* switch to directory and compile sources
  ::

      cd /ssr/mex/win64
      make

* open Matlab and add ``SSR_DIR/mex/`` to Matlab-path using ``pathtool`` or ``addpath``

That's all, now you should be able to :ref:`use the Two!Ears Binaural Simulator <sec-binsim-usage>`.
