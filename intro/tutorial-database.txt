Work with the database
======================

The database is located at the following address: |database-url|, where you can
browse the data, or download single files. Fortunately, the |BinSim| has an
automatic download and caching functionality, which gets the files from the
database on demand. Downloading the files twice is prevented by the caching
mechanism.

For example, you could browse the database and get any file you want by
specifying its relative position inside the database. The next command will
download a WAV-file for you which you can then use inside Matlab::

    >> filename = db.getFile('stimuli/anechoic/instruments/anechoic_cello.wav');
    >> sig = wavread(filename);

In addition, as we have seen in the :ref:`sec-tutorial-acoustic-scene` tutorial
you normally never directly use the ``db.getFile()`` function, but ask for
database files inside a scene description file. For example, in order to use a
|HRTF| from the :ref:`sec-hrtf-qu-kemar` you have to add the following address
to your scene configuration:

.. code-block:: xml

    <scene HRIRs="impulse_responses/qu_kemar_anechoic/QU_KEMAR_anechoic_3m.sofa">

The |BinSim| will then automatically call the ``db.getFile()`` function in
order to get the desired |HRTF|.

For more advanced usages of the database, have a look at
:ref:`sec-database-usage`. There, it is also explained where the automatic
downloaded files are stored and how they could be deleted.
