Installation guide
==================

To install the |TwoEarsModel| download |LatestVersion|, unzip it, and
store it somewhere on your PC. The download includes only the files needed to
run it in Matlab. Additional files such as |HRTF| data will be downloaded later
by the model on-the-fly if needed.

We have tested the software with Matlab versions from 2012b to 2015b.
You will also need the Signal Processing toolbox. Currently the Statistics 
toolbox is also required for some plotting functions, but we expect to remove
this dependency in a future release.

When stored on your PC, you should add the main folder to your Matlab path and
then run the ``startTwoEars`` function, which will add the necessary sub-folders.
From within the main folder do the following:

.. code-block:: Matlab

    >> addpath(pwd)
    >> startTwoEars

When you are planning to use the |BinSim| module you have to prepare the
following things:

    * **Linux/Mac**: install the packages *make*, *g++ (at least version
      4.7.3)*, *libsndfile1-dev*, *libxml2-dev*, *libfftw3-dev*. Under Linux use
      your native package manager, e.g. apt-get, aptitude, yum. Under Mac you
      may use `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_ or `MacPorts
      <https://www.macports.org/>`_ to install the packages.
    * **Windows**: add ``TwoEarsDir\BinauralSimulator\src\mex\dll`` folder to
      ``PATH`` environment variable (`HOWTO`_).

We have experienced some issues regarding the precompiled \*.mex binaries on some
machines. If you get error messages related to the \*.mex files, please remove
the directory of your PATH again, if you are using Windows. Try to compile the
mex binaries by yourself using the tutorial given in :ref:`sec-binsim-install`.

Now everything is setup and you can use the model. We suggest that you start by
trying one of the :ref:`examples provided <sec-examples-localisation>`:

.. code-block:: Matlab

        >> cd examples/localisation_w_and_wo_head_movements
        >> localise;
