Robots are highly complex systems that embed numerous sensors and actuators, in
the service of a variety of algorithms performing heterogeneous tasks. They
often have to deal with severe requirements (timing constraints, limited energy,
memory and processing resources, *etc.*) and must show a robust conception as
uncertainty about their environment is high, and unexpected events can have
critical consequences. This sets some constrains on the underlying software
running on a robot. This section describes how this is dealt with by the robotic
community and introduces the software systems used on the Two!Ears robots.
