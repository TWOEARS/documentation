Motorization of a KEMAR head
============================

    :local:

Overview
--------

In this section, we propose a non-intrusive mechanism to motorize the head
rotation of a KEMAR |HATS|. It includes a silent brushless motor and two limit
sensors to constrain the admissible rotation range, assembled with designed
aluminium parts that preserve the original neck thickness and shape. The
mechanism, placing the motor inside the torso, is visible on
:numref:`fig-kemar-motor-assembly`.

    CAD view of the proposed mechanism and its integration in a KEMAR |HATS|

The instructions below detail how to set up this mechanism to get a motorized
KEMAR head.

Assembly of the mechanism
-------------------------

For this part, you will need:

* A KEMAR |HATS| Type 45BB-2
* A 100W brushless DC motor SA01ACN-8 from A2V, with gearhead PGE12/1 i=9
* Two proximity optical sensors VTF180-2N41112 from Sick
* The designed aluminium pieces (see instructions below)
* Anti-reflection adhesive film
* M4 screws

The steps to assemble the mechanism are as follows:

#. You first need to make the three aluminium pieces, visible in blue, red and
   green on :numref:`fig-kemar-motor-assembly`. CAD models are available in the
   `kemar-hardware <https://github.com/TWOEARS/kemar-hardware>`_ repository, in
   folder ``motorized-neck/mechanics``. File ``head.stp`` is the blue piece,
   fixed to the head. File ``torso.stp`` is the red piece, fixed to the
   torso. File ``rotation.stp`` is the green piece, fixed to the rotating axis
   of the motor. Last, file ``assembly.stp`` shows the pieces assembled together
   with the motor, it can help having a look at it while you mount the
   mechanism.

#. Remove the original part below the head and place the new head piece
   (blue). Keep and reuse the same screws. As this part will be placed above the
   proximity optical sensors, an anti-reflection adhesive film must be stuck to
   prevent any reflection (see :numref:`fig-kemar-motor-head`). The two audio
   cables can be passed through the arc-shaped hole.

#. Assemble the motor to the new aluminium part that will be fixed to the torso
   (red) with four M4 screws.  The arc-shaped hole will go at the rear of the
   new neck.

#. Place the two optical sensors into the dedicated holes (one on front, the
   second on left side). The nuts provided with the sensors are too big to be
   placed direcly. Nuts must be rounded first to be integrated.

#. On the last aluminium piece (green), place two plastic screws for head
   alignment (see :numref:`fig-kemar-motor-torso`). They will fit in the two
   corresponding holes on the head piece. Then position the rotating piece
   (green) on the motor shaft. There is a groove on the shaft. Align the two
   hexagonal screws with the groove and fix them.

#. Before placing the motor block at the top of the torso, optical sensor
   sensitivity must be adjusted on both sensors. Place the head and supply the
   sensors with +24V DC. Check that output sensors toggle when the head turns,
   otherwise tune the yellow screw on sensors to adjust. Then remove the head.

#. Remove the original black piece fixed on top of the torso, keep the
   screws. Place the motor block set at the top of the torso and screw it using
   these screws.

#. Pass the audio cables into the torso, place the head on the neck and screw
   it.

Assembly of the limit sensor circuitry
--------------------------------------

The role of the two limit sensors is to contrain the head rotation between -90°
and +90°, for human-like rotation and to avoid harms on the microphone cables. A
dedicated |PCB| must be manufactured.  :numref:`tab-kemar-motor-pcb` lists the
needed components, and Gerber files for the |PCB| are available in the
`kemar-hardware <https://github.com/TWOEARS/kemar-hardware>`_ repository, in
folder ``motorized-neck/electronics``.

Connection to the controller
----------------------------

For this part, you will need:

* A ELMO Harmonica HAR5/60C servo controller
* An encoder cable for Harmonica (CBLIC-BAS-J3)
* A power distribution cable (IA1507/2M)
* An auxiliary +24V DC cable for Harmonica (CBLIC-BAS-J4)

.. caution::

   Before switching the power supply ON, be sure to have connected all the
   listed elements.

The steps to connect all parts are as follows:

#. Connect the ELMO Controller (J3 connector) and the motor block set
   (incremental encoder + Hall effect sensors) using cable CBLIC-BAS-J3.

#. Connect limit detection PCB (J6 connector) to ELMO Controller (J5 connector).

   * J6.1 →  +24V DC power supply,
   * J6.2 →  Power supply return,
   * J6.3 →  J5.6 (ELMO Programmable input 6),
   * J6.4 →  J5.8 (ELMO Programmable input return),
   * J6.5 →  J5.5 (ELMO Programmable input 5),
   * J6.6 →  J5.7 (ELMO Programmable input return).

#. Connect the ELMO Controller (J4 connector) to an auxiliary +24V DC power
   supply using cable CBLIC-BAS-J4. If an auxiliary power supply is not
   available connect the cable to the +24V DC main power supply.

   * J4.1 →  +24V DC auxiliary power supply,
   * J4.2 →  Power supply return.

#. Connect the ELMO Controller (J1 -RJ-45 plug) to a RJ-45 to 9-pin D-sub
   adapter using an ethernet cable. The 9-pin D-sub connector is normalized
   according to CAN protocol.

   * J1.1 (CAN H) →  9-pin D-sub, pin 7,
   * J1.2 (CAN L) →  9-pin D-sub, pin 2,
   * J1.3 (CAN GND) →  9-pin D-sub, pin 3.

   Do not forget to solder a 120 Ohms termination resistor between pin 7 and pin
   2 of 9-pin D-sub adapter.

#. Connect the ELMO Controller (J8 connector), available on the side of the
   controller to the motor phases and main power supply.

   * J8.1 (VP+) →  +24V DC power supply,
   * J8.2 (PR) →  Power supply return,
   * J8.3 (PE) →  If available connect to protective earth,
   * J8.4 (PE) →  motor protective earth (motor body),
   * J8.5 (M1) →  motor phase 1,
   * J8.6 (M2) →  motor phase 2,
   * J8.7 (M3) →  motor phase 3.

   There are no constraints in the pinning of M1, M2 and M3.

#. Last, connect the limit detector |PCB|

   * J3.1 →  L/D wire (white), lateral sensor,
   * J3.2 →  Q (black), lateral sensor,
   * J3.3 →  - (blue), lateral sensor,
   * J3.4 →  + (brown), lateral sensor,
   * J3.5 →  L/D wire (white), front sensor,
   * J3.6 →  Q (black), front sensor,
   * J3.7 →  - (blue), front sensor,
   * J3.8 →  + (brown), front sensor.

   Place jumpers on J4 and J5 connectors between GND and center pin.

Associated software
-------------------

The designed mechanism has associated open-source drivers that can be installed
to control the rotation from a software application. You can install them with:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone -b kemar-head https://git.openrobots.org/robots/elmo-axis-libs.git
   cd elmo-axis-libs
   mkdir m4
   autoreconf -vi
   mkdir build && cd build
   ../configure --prefix=/path/to/your/install/folder
   make install

The `kemar-control <https://github.com/TWOEARS/kemar-control>`_ repository
contains a |GenoM3| component using these drivers to control the head rotation
in position or in speed via dedicated services. You can install it with:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/TWOEARS/kemar-control.git
   cd kemar-control
   genom3 skeleton -i kemar.gen
   ./bootstrap.sh
   mkdir build && cd build
   ../configure --prefix=/path/to/your/install/folder --with-templates=ros/server,ros/client/c
   make install

The example chapter includes a simple use of this component to :ref:`Control the
rotation of a KEMAR motorized head from Matlab <sec-examples-tutorial-kemar>`.
