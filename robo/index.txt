Addressing real-life experiments (such as dynamic auditory scene analysis in a
*search and rescue* scenario) implies to deploy and run the |TwoEarsModel| on a
robotic platform. To assess the active and exploratory features of the model and
its ability to handle multi-modality, the robot must be endowed with binaural
perception, adequate mobility, and other sensing modalities. It must come with a
software platform enabling the concurrent execution of all the processes
involved in the model. To ensure reproducible research, this architecture must
enable maximum software sharing when switching from one platform to another.

This chapter first decribes general aspects of the :ref:`robotic software
architecture <sec-robot-software>`, using the celebrated |ROS| middleware. Then,
dedicated components to :ref:`stream audio <sec-robot-audio-streaming>` are
documented. Guidelines to :ref:`motorize a kemar head
<sec-robot-head-motorization>` are provided to tackle active perception
scenarios. Last, a :ref:`ROS auditory front-end <sec-rosafe>` is presented.
