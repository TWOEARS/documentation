Component-based software architectures in robotics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robots are highly complex systems that embed numerous sensors and actuators, in
the service of a variety of algorithms performing heterogeneous tasks. They
often have to deal with severe requirements (timing constraints, limited energy,
memory and processing resources, *etc.*) and must show a robust conception as
uncertainty about their environment is high, and unexpected events can have
critical consequences.

To facilitate the development of robotic software, **component-based
architectures**, where components are independent processes, have become the *de
facto* standard in robotics. Each software component is dedicated to a given
task, from low-level control to high-level processing. Components communicate
with each other with the help of a software piece called the **middleware**.

For instance, consider a robot embedding a camera and performing object
detection in the images. One component could be in charge of acquiring the
images using the camera's driver, and would output them. Another component could
input the images and run an algorithm on them to detect objects, producing the
detection result as output for any other component in need of this
information. Routing data from the output of the first component to the input of
the second one is ensured by the middleware, this is called **data flow**.

Components offer **services** to the user to modify their behaviour and adapt to
different situations. To follow with the example above, the component acquiring
images could provide a service to select which camera to use, another one to
configure parameters such as the image size and the number of frames per second,
a third one to explicitly request the start of the acquisition, *etc.* The
component detecting objects could have a service to change some parameters in
the detection algorithm, another one to choose which image stream to take as
input (because there could be several components streaming images from different
cameras), *etc.* Making services available to the user is again handled by the
middleware, this is called **control flow**.

.. note::

    The *user* mentioned here is not necessarily a physical person. For
    autonomous robots, it will probably be a detached software piece,
    supervising the state of the robot and choosing to start a given service to
    accomplish a new goal. This software piece belongs to the **decisional
    level**, while other components make up the **functional level**.

Component-based software architectures offer great benefits in robotics, in
particular [1]_:

* **Modularity**
    * As many operations handled by a robot require to have their own thread of
      execution (*e.g.* data acquisition for sensors, motion control for
      actuators), having them in separate programs eases their concurrent
      execution.
    * The architecture can be adapted to the needs of the robot: adding a new
      hardware piece such as a sensor will result in running a new software
      component to drive it.
    * The system can be distributed over a network, as the middleware seamlessly
      ensures communication between components running on different host
      machines.

* **Re-usability**
    * Common components can be used across robots without having to recode them
      from scratch.
    * Components can be packaged and easily shared in the robotics community,
      where open source software prevails.
    * Re-usable components reduce development cost and time, while improving
      software quality and sustainability.

|ROS|, a software platform for robotics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`previous section <sec-cbsa>` identifies the *middleware* as the
software piece ensuring data flow between functional components, and allowing
their control.

|ROS| is a widely known software platform in robotics, providing not only a
middleware, but also implementing a wide range of commonly-used functionalities
into software components (such as localisation, mapping, path-planning, obstacle
avoidance, *etc.*), with a build system and a packaging system for easy
compilation and installation. |ROS| benefits from a large community of users and
developers, and runs on many robots today. This makes |ROS| a common choice as a
robotic software platform, as it is for |TwoEars|.

|ROS| embraces the principles of component-based software architectures,
allowing distributed computation, software reuse and rapid testing [2]_. If you
will be a user of a robotic platform running |ROS|, the `core tutorials
<http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials>`_ can help you to get familiar with the
|ROS| environment. The main |ROS| terminology, introduced in the tutorials, is
recalled here:

Nodes
    Software components using |ROS| middleware are called |ROS| **nodes**.

Topics and messages
    Data flows are called **topics**. A node that outputs data *publishes* on a
    topic. A node that inputs data *subscribes* to a topic. The data elements
    flowing on topics are called **messages**. Each message is made of various
    data fields forming part of a data structure called *message type*. As a
    given topic only carries one message type, the term *topic type* is equally
    used.

Services and actions
    Nodes can provide **services** to control them. Some special services that
    can take a long time to execute are called **actions**.

.. note::

    In spite of its name, |ROS| does not replace, but instead works alongside a
    traditional operating system. As it provides features such as hardware
    abstraction and low-level device control [3]_, |ROS| has some similarities
    with an OS (Operating System), hence its name.

|GenoM3|, a tool to develop robotic components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process of developing robotic components can significantly be improved by
the mean of a tool called |GenoM3|. As a result of two decades of research on
real time architectures for autonomous systems [4]_ [5]_, |GenoM3| brings
valuable attributes to robotic components:

* **Middleware independence**

    Components developed with |GenoM3| are middleware independent, *i.e.* they
    are not tied to a specific middleware and can be compiled for different
    middlewares without changing their source code.

    This is achieved through the notion of *templates*: a |GenoM3| template is a
    set of instructions which, when applied to the component's source files,
    automatically generates the code related to middleware communication. A
    clear separation of concerns between the algorithmic core and the middleware
    is thus conducted, helping towards the good design of robotic components.

    |ROS| appears among the middlewares supported by |GenoM3|. When using |ROS|
    templates to compile a |GenoM3| component, the resulting program is a
    genuine |ROS| node. Only the development process differs from what could be
    done by writing a |ROS| node without the |GenoM3| tool.

* **Model-driven design**

    |GenoM3| emphasises the clear definition of robotic components by adopting a
    model-driven approach. A |GenoM3| component is first defined by a
    description file, called the **dotgen** file, with the ``.gen``
    extension. This file gathers in a single place all the definitions related
    to the component's interface, needed by a user to interact with it.

    Each |GenoM3| component has its own dotgen file, mainly including the
    definition of its **services** and its data flows by the mean of **ports**
    (either from the component to the outside, or the other way round). Each
    service is defined by a name and a list of input and output parameters with
    their related data type. Each port is defined by a name, a direction (either
    in or out), and a data type for the data elements it uses. The dotgen file
    often include in-line documentation to help the understanding of the
    component's features (for instance, the role of a given service parameter).

    On the basis of the model specified in the dotgen file, |GenoM3|
    automatically generates real time code as well as skeletons of functions run
    by the services. So, the developer just has to fill these functions, called
    **codels** (for code element) with its algorithms. The corresponding
    algorithmic core is written in separate C or C++ source files or libraries.

* **Powerful framework**

    |GenoM3| facilitates the development of essential features for robotic
    components, such as:

    * the definition of finite state automata with an optional clock,
    * clean interruption mechanisms,
    * efficient error handling.

If you decide to be a user of |GenoM3| components, the tutorial `GenoM3 through
an example
<https://git.openrobots.org/projects/genom3/wiki/Genom3tutorialdemo-genom3>`_
will help you to learn how to read dotgen files. For a developer of |GenoM3|
components, the `documentation
<https://git.openrobots.org/projects/genom3/gollum/index>`_ defines the whole
grammar for writing dotgen files, and how dotgen specifications are mapped into
C or C++ codels.

.. note::

    |GenoM3| components are often called **modules** (hence the name *Generator
    of Modules*). The words *module* and *component* refer to the same entity:
    an independent program that can run on a host machine where the robotic
    software architecture is distributed.

Installation of the robotic tools
---------------------------------

The robotic tools should be installed on any system that hosts components of the
software architecture for the |robot|. This section details the installation
process.

.. note::

    For all the guidelines gathered here, we will assume that you are using
    Ubuntu GNU/Linux as it is the supported distribution for |ROS| (though any
    other UNIX platform should be suited to the |GenoM3| tools). Many commands
    given here are intended for the :command:`bash` shell. If you use a
    different shell, you should adapt the bash-related commands accordingly.

Install |ROS|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |ROS| distribution you can install will depend on your Ubuntu version:

* If you have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or 13.10, follow the `ROS Indigo installation
  instructions`_.
* Otherwise, follow the `ROS Hydro installation instructions`_.

.. _ROS Indigo installation instructions: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu
.. _ROS Hydro installation instructions: http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu

Install the |GenoM3| tools through |robotpkg|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section will guide you through the installation of the |GenoM3|
tools. |GenoM3| is open-source software (available at
https://git.openrobots.org/) and can be compiled from source, but the common
installation uses |robotpkg|, a compilation framework and packaging system for
robotics software (more information at http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/).

Get |robotpkg| on your system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

     The following instructions invite you to download two git repositories. If
     the given URLs using ``git://`` protocol fail, try ``https://`` protocol as
     instructed `here <http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/install.html>`_ and `there
     <http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/robotpkg-wip.html>`_.
     If you need an introduction to git have a look at
     :ref:`sec-git-for-beginners`.

First, get the ``robotpkg`` repository in your home folder (you can choose
another location, but we recommend this one):

.. code-block:: bash

    cd
    git clone git://git.openrobots.org/robots/robotpkg

You will also need the `wip <http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/robotpkg-wip.html>`_
subset of |robotpkg|, it contains some work in progress that is not officially
released, but already available:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/robotpkg
    git clone git://git.openrobots.org/robots/robotpkg/robotpkg-wip wip

Next, set the installation path. The tools that you will soon install will be
placed in your home folder under a dedicated folder named
``openrobots``. Installing robotic components in your home folder ensures that
you do not need root privileges for the installation (you can choose another
location with a different prefix, but we recommend this one):

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/robotpkg/bootstrap
    ./bootstrap --prefix $HOME/openrobots

To finish, update your environment variables to include the installation
folder:

.. note::

    In the following commands, note the use of an environment variable
    :envvar:`ROBOTPKG_BASE` to indicate your installation path, set to
    ``$HOME/openrobots``. If you have selected a different location at the
    previous step, you should modify the corresponding command accordingly.

.. code-block:: bash

    echo >> ~/.bashrc
    echo '# ROBOTPKG' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export ROBOTPKG_BASE=$HOME/openrobots' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/bin:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/sbin' \
         >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:\
         $ROBOTPKG_BASE/lib/pkgconfig' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:\
         $ROBOTPKG_BASE/src/ros-nodes:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/share' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:\
         $ROBOTPKG_BASE/lib/python2.7/site-packages:\
         $ROBOTPKG_BASE/lib/python3.2/site-packages' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo '# ROBOTPKG END' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

.. _sec-install-robotpkg-package:

How to install a |robotpkg| package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your ``~/robotpkg`` directory contains a tree of packages, grouped into main
categories. In the next part, we will invite you to install some of those
packages. Here, we expose you the guidelines to follow for each package.

1. **Add options to the package**

    If you are asked to add options ``option-1 option-2 ...`` to the package
    ``pkg-name``, edit the file :file:`~/openrobots/etc/robotpkg.conf` and add a
    line (near the beginning for instance) looking like::

        PKG_OPTIONS.pkg-name+= option-1 option-2 ...

    You will get a better idea about this step with an actual example in the
    next part.

2. **Move to the package's directory**

    You will be given the path to the package, such as
    ``robotpkg/category/pkg-name``. Change to this directory:

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd ~/robotpkg/category/pkg-name

3. **Install possibly missing system dependencies**

    Run the following command to list the dependencies for the package you are
    about to install:

    .. code-block:: bash

        make show-depends

    At the end of the command's output, the dependencies are separated into
    ``Robotpkg dependencies`` and ``System dependencies``. If any |robotpkg|
    dependency is missing, it will be automatically installed. If any system
    dependency is missing, you need to install it (commonly with
    :command:`apt-get` under Ubuntu). Iterate this step until no system
    dependency is missing.

    You may skip this step, but if a system dependency is missing, the package
    installation will stop at some point and you will be asked to install it.

4. **Install the package**

    Run the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        make update

    This will download the sources, compile them locally on your system, and
    install the output files in the ``~/openrobots`` directory.

Install packages for |GenoM3|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Install the package ``demo-genom3`` from ``robotpkg/doc/demo-genom3`` with
  options ``codels ros-server ros-client-ros ros-client-c``.

    This package will install the *demo* component. It is a sample component
    distributed with |GenoM3|, serving as an example, simply controlling the
    motion of a fictional robot. The aim of installing the *demo* component is
    twofold: first, it automatically installs all the dependencies for using
    |GenoM3| (the provided options specifying that we will use the |ROS|
    templates); second, you get a |GenoM3| component ready to be run to start
    using the robotic tools.

    For your convenience, here is how applying the :ref:`above steps
    <sec-install-robotpkg-package>` could look like:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # 1. Add options to the package
        echo 'PKG_OPTIONS.demo-genom3+= codels ros-server ros-client-ros ros-client-c'\
              >> ~/openrobots/etc/robotpkg.conf
        # or better, edit the file manually and add the line near the beginning

        # 2. Change to the package's directory
        cd ~/robotpkg/wip/demo-genom3

        # 3. Install missing system dependencies
        make show-depends
        # Let's say that `make show-depends` revealed two missing system
        # dependencies named 'bison' and 'flex'. Next step would be:
        sudo apt-get install bison flex
        make show-depends
        # No missing system dependency left

        # 4. Install the package
        make update

* Then, install the packages ``genomix`` from ``robotpkg/net/genomix`` and
  ``rosix`` from ``robotpkg/net/rosix``.

    |genomix| and |rosix| are HTTP servers providing an interface for some
    clients to control |GenoM3| components and generic |ROS| nodes respectively.

* Then, install the packages ``tcl-genomix`` from ``robotpkg/wip/tcl-genomix``
  and ``matlab-genomix`` from ``robotpkg/supervision/matlab-genomix``.

    These are clients of |genomix| and |rosix| servers. The |tcl-genomix| client
    allows to control components using the Tcl language. Its installation is not
    mandatory (we will rather use the |matlab-genomix| client), but recommended
    as a common package distributed with |GenoM3|. The |matlab-genomix| client
    allows to control components from Matlab.

    .. note::

        You need a Matlab installation on your system in order to install the
        ``matlab-genomix`` package. If you encounter a missing dependency for
        ``mex`` (the MEX compiler from Matlab), you need to add the path to
        Matlab executables to the :envvar:`PATH` environment variable. For
        example, with Matlab R2013a installed in ``/usr/local/MATLAB/R2013a``,
        it would be done with:

        .. code-block:: bash

            export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/MATLAB/R2013a/bin

The |GenoM3| tools are now installed on your system. If you want to try the
Matlab bridge, you can follow the official `tutorial using the demo component
<https://git.openrobots.org/projects/matlab-genomix/gollum/demo>`_. You can also
follow the instructions below to install :ref:`sec-bass` and later on follow the
tutorial :ref:`sec-examples-tutorial-bass`.

.. note::

    The Matlab bridge is installed in ``~/openrobots/lib/matlab``. To follow the
    tutorials using |matlab-genomix|, you need to add this path to the Matlab
    path.

Install a |GenoM3| component from the sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The software part of the |TwoEars| robotic architecture includes several
|GenoM3| components. You may have to install them from their source files. Each
|GenoM3| component has its own folder, containing a description file named after
the component with the ``.gen`` extension (something like
:file:`component.gen`). These steps will install the component in your
``~/openrobots`` folder:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd path/to/component/folder
    genom3 skeleton -i component.gen
    ./bootstrap.sh
    mkdir build && cd build
    ../configure --prefix=$ROBOTPKG_BASE --with-templates=ros/server,ros/client/c
    make install

Example: installing the |BASS| component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|BASS| is a :ref:`component for binaural audio streaming <sec-bass>`. The folder
for this component is named ``bass-genom3``, under the ``RoboticPlateform``
folder of the software repository. Applying the above commands to install |BASS|
gives:

.. code-block:: bash

    # assuming that you are in the software repository
    cd RoboticPlateform/bass-genom3
    genom3 skeleton -i bass.gen
    ./bootstrap.sh
    mkdir build && cd build
    ../configure --prefix=$ROBOTPKG_BASE --with-templates=ros/server,ros/client/c
    make install
