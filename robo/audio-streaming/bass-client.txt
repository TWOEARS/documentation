This section provides information about designing clients of the |BASS|
component. It first defines a formal algorithm that clients could use, and shows
a sample implementation in a |GenoM3| component called |BASC|.

An algorithm for clients of |BASS|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A client of |BASS| can face many different situations:

* It may need just a single block of data (*e.g.* we could think of a client
  requesting 2 seconds of audio data to learn noise properties), and the block
  may be longer than the total size of the port.
* It may indefinitely request new blocks of data, with the requirement that they
  follow each other without frame loss between two consecutive blocks.
* It may request data faster than the port update rate. Or conversely, it may
  not read the port often enough, leading to data loss. And in case of data
  loss, it must know how many frames were lost.

Let us define :math:`nFOP` as the total number of *frames on the port*. The data
structure used on the ``Audio`` port, of type ``portStruct``, is recalled in
:numref:`tab-bass-port-struct-formal`.

           ``Audio`` port of |BASS|

  +====================+==================+=================================+
  |``sampleRate``      |unsigned integer  |sample rate in Hz                |
  +--------------------+------------------+---------------------------------+
  |``nChunksOnPort``   |unsigned integer  |number of chunks on the port     |
  |                    |                  |(:math:`nCOP`)                   |
  +--------------------+------------------+---------------------------------+
  |``nFramesPerChunk`` |unsigned integer  |number of frames per chunk       |
  |                    |                  |(:math:`nFPC`)                   |
  +--------------------+------------------+---------------------------------+
  |``lastFrameIndex``  |unsigned integer  |index for tracking data          |
  +--------------------+------------------+---------------------------------+
  |``left[nFOP]``      |array of integers |arrays of :math:`nFOP` samples,  |
  +--------------------+------------------+with :math:`nFOP = nFPC * nCOP`  |
  |``right[nFOP]``     |array of integers |                                 |
  +--------------------+------------------+---------------------------------+

The ``left`` and ``right`` fields are arrays of :math:`nFOP` samples each,
updated as |FIFO|\ s (*c.f.* :ref:`related section in BASS documentation
<sec-bass-output-port>`). What the client need is to copy blocks of given size
:math:`N` from these arrays. Let us define a function ``getAudioData``, taking
:math:`N` as input and returning one copied block.

In order not to miss any frame between blocks retrieved with two consecutive
calls, the ``getAudioData`` function also takes both as input and output an
index of the *next frame to be read*, noted :math:`nfr`. For instance, the
client get a first block of :math:`N` frames starting from a given index
:math:`nfr`. The function must return, along with the block of data, the new
value of the index, corresponding to the next frame right after the first
retrieved block. Then, the client can call the function again with this new
value for :math:`nfr`, so as to get the second block starting from this point.

For the very first block, the client can choose :math:`nfr` according to the
current value of the ``lastFrameIndex``.

* If it wants to pick data from the existing frames on the port, :math:`nfr` is
  chosen to be less than ``lastFrameIndex``.
* If it wants to get fresher data (frames that are not yet on the port but will
  be published shortly on it), :math:`nfr` is chosen to be greater than
  ``lastFrameIndex``.

With a call to ``getAudioData``, the client requests a block of given size
:math:`N`, but the function may not be able to return a full block of :math:`N`
frames. Indeed, the ending point for the desired block may be a frame that is
not yet published by the server. So, the function returns the number :math:`n`
of frames it can get (:math:`n \le N`). The client can then call the function
again and ask for the remaining frames in a loop until the requested block is
complete. Here are examples of when this can occur:

* The client requests data more often than they are captured by the microphones
  (which should be the regular case, because a slower client will end up losing
  data).
* The client requests a block which is longer than the total number of frames on
  the port (:math:`N > nFOP`).
* At first call, if the client sets :math:`nfr` to a greater value than
  ``lastFrameIndex``, then ``getAudioData`` will not return any available frame
  (:math:`n = 0`). But the client can keep calling the function in a loop until
  it gets the requested frames.

Finally, in case of data loss, ``getAudioData`` also returns the number of
frames that were lost. The retrieved block then starts at the first frame that
is still available on the port (the oldest one).

Below is the ``getAudioData`` function written with formal syntax::

  function: getAudioData
  |
  | inputs:  integer     N     (number of frames the client wants to get)
  |          portStruct  Audio (data from the the output port of bass)
  |
  | outputs: integer     n     (number of frames the function was able to get)
  |          integer     loss  (number of lost frames, 0 if no loss)
  |          array(int)  l[n]  (the retrieved data block from left channel)
  |          array(int)  r[n]  (the retrieved data block from right channel)
  |
  | in&out:  integer     nfr   (index of the Next Frame to Read)
  |
  | local:   integer     nFOP  (total number of Frames On the Port)
  |          integer     lfi   (Index of the Last Frame on the port)
  |          integer     ofi   (Index of the Oldest Frame on the port)
  |          integer     pos   (current position in the left and right arrays)
  |
  | algorithm
  |  |
  |  | nFOP <- Audio.nFramesPerChunk * Audio.nChunksOnPort
  |  | lfi <- Audio.lastFrameIndex
  |  | ofi <- max(0, lfi - nFOP + 1) //if the acquisition just started and the
  |  |                               //port is not full yet, ofi equals 0
  |  | /* Detect a data loss */
  |  | loss <- 0
  |  | if (nfr < ofi)
  |  |  | loss <- ofi - nfr
  |  |  | nfr <- ofi
  |  | end if
  |  |
  |  | /* Compute the starting position in the left and right input arrays */
  |  | pos <- nFOP - (lfi - nfr + 1)
  |  |
  |  | /* Fill the output arrays l and r */
  |  | n <- 0
  |  | while (n < N AND pos < nFOP)
  |  |  | l[n] <- Audio.left[pos]
  |  |  | r[n] <- Audio.right[pos]
  |  |  | n <- n + 1
  |  |  | pos <- pos + 1
  |  |  | nfr <- nfr + 1

Sample implementation in a |GenoM3| component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|BASC| is a |GenoM3| component that acts as a client of |BASS|. It can be
connected to the output port of |BASS|, and implements the above generic
algorithm to retrieve blocks of audio signals. |BASC| does not perform any
processing on the data. It only shows what a |GenoM3| client of |BASS| could
look like.

The folder containing source files of the component is named ``basc-genom3`` and
is located in the ``RoboticPlatform`` folder of the software repository. All
files that are referred to in this section are in the ``basc-genom3`` folder.

Services
^^^^^^^^

|BASC| runs the above algorithm in a service called ``GetBlocks``, defined in
description file :file:`basc.gen`. It expects the following input parameters:

  +--------------------+------------------+--------------+---------------------+
  |Name                |Data type         |Default value |Documentation        |
  +====================+==================+==============+=====================+
  |``nBlocks``         |``unsigned long`` |``1``         |Amount of blocks, 0  |
  |                    |                  |              |for unlimited        |
  +--------------------+------------------+--------------+---------------------+
  |``nFramesPerBlock`` |``unsigned long`` |``12000``     |Block size in frames |
  +--------------------+------------------+--------------+---------------------+
  |``startOffs``       |``long``          |``-12000``    |Starting offset      |
  |                    |                  |              |(*past* < 0, *future*|
  |                    |                  |              |> 0)                 |
  +--------------------+------------------+--------------+---------------------+

The first parameter ``nBlocks`` sets the number of blocks that the service must
get, or can be set to 0 to run the service indefinitely. The second parameter
``nFramesPerBlock`` sets the block size (:math:`N` in the previous
section). Last, the ``startOffs`` parameter sets the index of the first frame to
read, relatively to the current value of the Last Frame Index on the port. For
instance, if ``startOffs`` is -1000 and ``lastFrameIndex`` is 43000 when the
service is called, then the first frame to read (:math:`nfr` in previous
section) will have index 42000. With the given default values, ``GetBlocks``
will get 1 block of 12000 frames, taking the last 12000 frames on the port.

At any moment, the GetBlocks service can be interrupted by calling a service
named ``Stop``.

Execution example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assume that the ``GetBlocks`` service runs at a period of, say, 250ms (defined
in the dotgen file). So every 250ms, it calls the ``getAudioData`` function,
either to request a new block or to complete the current block if the previous
call could not return a full one. Depending on the sample rate, if the requested
block size (parameter ``nFramesPerBlock``) is too small so that one block is
less than 250ms, then the client will eventually loose some frames. On the other
hand, if a block lasts more than 250ms, then the client will request data at a
rate higher than their update frequency, which should be fine.

This can be tested: assume that the sampling rate is 44100Hz. So, 250ms is 11025
frames. Calling ``GetBlocks`` with ``nFramesPerBlock < 11025`` leads to data
loss. Following is an example with the |matlab-genomix| client.

.. code-block:: matlab

  % The middleware, genomix, bass and basc should be running

  % Connect to genomix
  >> client = genomix.client

  % Load the server BASS and the client BASC
  >> bass = client.load('bass')
  >> basc = client.load('basc')

  % Connect the input port of BASC to the output port of BASS
  >> basc.connect_port('Audio', 'bass/Audio')

  % Start the acquisition (using default values)
  rAcquire = bass.Acquire('-a', 'hw:1,0', 44100, 2205, 20)

  %%% EXAMPLE 1: get one block of 2 seconds (88200 frames at 44100Hz)
  >> basc.GetBlocks(1, 88200, 0)

  % In the terminal where it runs, BASC prints:
  %
  %    Requested  88200 frames, got  11025.
  %    Requested  77175 frames, got  11025.
  %    Requested  66150 frames, got  11025.
  %    Requested  55125 frames, got  11025.
  %    Requested  44100 frames, got  11025.
  %    Requested  33075 frames, got  11025.
  %    Requested  22050 frames, got  11025.
  %    Requested  11025 frames, got  11025.
  %    A new block is ready to be processed.
  %
  % Each line 'Requested N frames, got n.' indicates the number N of frames
  % requested by BASC, and the number n it got in return. The component keeps
  % requesting frames until it has formed a block of 88200 frames.

  %%% EXAMPLE 2: get unlimited number of blocks, with nFramesPerBlock < 11025
  >> rGetBlocks = basc.GetBlocks('-a', 0, 10000, 0)

  % After a few seconds, BASC prints:
  %
  %    Requested  10000 frames, got  10000.
  %    !!Lost 1025 frames!!
  %    A new block is ready to be processed.
  %    Requested  10000 frames, got  10000.
  %    !!Lost 1025 frames!!
  %    A new block is ready to be processed.
  %
  % At each attempt to get the following block, some frames are lost because
  % BASC does not read the port of BASS often enough.

  % Stop the running GetBlocks service
  >> basc.Stop()

  %%% EXAMPLE 3: get unlimited number of blocks, with nFramesPerBlock > 11025
  >> rGetBlocks = basc.GetBlocks('-a', 0, 12000,0)

  % Here, as BASC reads the port slighlty faster than its update rate, the
  % retrieved block is sometimes incomplete, for instance:
  %
  %    Requested  12000 frames, got  12000.
  %    A new block is ready to be processed.
  %    Requested  12000 frames, got  12000.
  %    A new block is ready to be processed.
  %    Requested  12000 frames, got  11550.
  %    Requested    450 frames, got    450.
  %    A new block is ready to be processed.
  %    Requested  12000 frames, got  12000.
  %    A new block is ready to be processed.
  %
  % The two consecutive lines 'Requested...' show that a first call only get
  % 11550 frames, so the component  makes a second request to get the remaining
  % part of 12000 - 11550 = 450 frames.

  % Stop the running GetBlocks service
  >> basc.Stop()

  % Kill the components
  >> bass.kill()
  >> basc.kill()

  % Remove the used objects in Matlab
  >> delete(bass)
  >> delete(basc)
  >> delete(client)

  % The remaining processes (the middleware and genomix) can be killed

The ``getAudioData`` function in charge of getting the requested block is
written in C in file :file:`codels/basc_read_codels.c`. The codels
of the ``GetBlocks`` service are also written in this file, with comments to
explain the overall process followed by |BASC|.
