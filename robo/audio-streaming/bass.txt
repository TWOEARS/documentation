|BASS|, an audio streaming server component
-------------------------------------------

.. contents::
    :depth: 1
    :local:

|BASS| is a |GenoM3| component in charge of acquiring binaural audio data from a
hardware sound interface, and making it available to other components,
henceforth termed as its clients. It relies on the |ALSA| library to communicate
with the hardware interface, hence working with any |ALSA|-compliant interface.

The component offers services to start and stop the acquisition of audio data,
and streams the captured data on an output port. A sliding window of the most
recent data is kept on the port, the size of which can be set at runtime (for
instance, the port can be configured so as to keep the last 2 seconds of
acquired signals).

The folder containing source files of the component is named ``bass-genom3`` and
is located in the ``RoboticPlatform`` folder of the software repository. All
files that are referred to in this section are in the ``bass-genom3`` folder.

|BASS| terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section defines the notions and the vocabulary that |BASS| uses.

Interface and device
  They are synonyms for the hardware board in charge of converting analog sound
  signals into digital streams.

Acquisition and capture
  They are synonyms for retrieving audio data from microphones through an audio
  interface.

Binaural audio and channels
  **Binaural audio** signals consist of two **channels** (like stereo audio),
  corresponding to left and right ears.

Samples and frames
  A **sample** is a digital value encoding the signal on one channel at one
  point in time. A **frame** is a vector of samples, one from each channel, at
  one point in time (thus for binaural audio, a frame is two samples).

Chunks
  In capturing state, the sound device regularly delivers blocks of new data to
  the |BASS| component. These blocks are called **chunks**. The size of these
  chunks (commonly given in number of frames) can be selected at the start of a
  new acquisition, and is fixed until its end.

.. note::

    The above definitions can differ from other applications where the word
    *frame* may refer to data blocks of a few milliseconds. Here, these blocks
    are rather called *chunks*, a frame being a single point in time.

Services
~~~~~~~~

The services offered by |BASS| are defined and documented in the description
file :file:`bass.gen`. This section lists them and provides additional details.

* The ``ListDevices`` service can be called to display on standard output stream
  (*stdout*) the available sound devices that can be selected for the
  acquisition.

* The ``Acquire`` service starts the acquisition of audio data and updates the
  output port with the captured data (see details about the port in section
  :ref:`sec-bass-output-port`). This service expects 4 input parameters, shown
  in :numref:`tab-bass-acquire-input-params`.

  .. _tab-bass-acquire-input-params:

    |                    |long``     |              |                      |
    +--------------------+-----------+--------------+----------------------+
    |``nChunksOnPort``   |``unsigned |``20``        | Port size in chunks  |
    |                    |long``     |              |                      |
    +--------------------+-----------+--------------+----------------------+

  The ``device`` parameter is the identifier of a sound device to use. The value
  for one connected device can be retrieved with the aforementioned
  ``ListDevices`` service. The ``nFramesPerChunk`` parameter is important, as
  smaller chunks will lead to shorter latency but also higher communication
  needs between the component and the device. Last, the ``nChunksOnPort``
  parameter sets the number of chunks kept on the port. With the default values
  given above, 20 chunks of 2205 frames is a total of 44100 frames kept on the
  port, i.e. 1 second of audio data at the default sample rate.

  The ``Acquire`` service can return an exception if the configuration of the
  interface fails (*e.g.* the requested sample rate is not supported), if a
  problem occurs during the acquisition (*e.g.* the interface gets unplugged),
  *etc.* If an exception occurs, the user can get more information by reading
  the error message flushed on standard error stream (*stderr*).

* The ``Stop`` service stops the acquisition of audio data. Note that the
  ``Acquire`` service also interrupts itself, so a new acquisition with
  different parameters can directly be started from a running one without having
  to call ``Stop``.

.. _sec-bass-output-port:

Output port
~~~~~~~~~~~

The data captured by the ``Acquire`` service are streamed on an output port
named ``Audio`` (defined in file :file:`bassInterface.gen`). They are gathered
in two arrays, one for each channel, updated with a |FIFO| design: every time a
new chunk is retrieved from the hardware interface, the content of the arrays is
shifted, deleting the oldest chunk of data and making room to the newest one, as
detailed below.

At the beginning of the acquisition, the arrays are filled with zeros and the
first captured chunks are progressively added. For instance, the state of one
array before and after adding the 4th chunk is illustrated here (assuming that
the port is longer than 4 chunks)::

  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
  |                 zeros                 |   1   |   2   |   3   |
  |                                       |       |       |       |
  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
                                           /       /       /
                                          /       /       /
                                         /       /       /
  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
  |             zeros             |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |
  |                               |       |       |       | (new) |
  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

The length of the port is a round number of chunks, set with parameter
``nChunksOnPort`` of the ``Acquire`` service (noted :math:`nCOP` below). The
size of one chunk is also set when calling ``Acquire``, with parameter
``nFramesPerChunk`` (noted :math:`nFPC` below). Thus, the left and right arrays
contain :math:`nFPC*nCOP` samples each. Once the port is entirely filled with
data (all beginning zeros have been erased), the oldest chunk is deleted as a
new chunk arrives::

  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
  |   1   |   2   |   3   |          ...          | nCOP-1|  nCOP |
  | (old) |       |       |                       |       |       |

           /       /                                       /
          /       /                                       /
         /       /                                       /

  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
           /       /                                       /
          /       /                                       /
         /       /                                       /
  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

In order to let the clients keep track of the data and detect any loss, the port
also publishes an index that indicates the number of frames that have been
streamed since the beginning of the acquisition. In other words, it is the index
of the last streamed frame, noted ``lastFrameIndex``. The data structure of the
``Audio`` output port (defined in file :file:`bassStruct.idl`) is summarised in
:numref:`tab-bass-port-struct`.

* The fields ``sampleRate``, ``nChunksOnPort`` and ``nFramesPerChunk`` are set
  as input parameters of the ``Acquire`` service.

* The fields ``left`` and ``right`` are dynamic arrays (``sequence<long>`` type)
  of :math:`nFPC*nCOP` samples. Samples are signed integers coded on 32 bits
  (``long`` type).

* The index for tracking data is stored in the field ``lastFrameIndex``. As this
  index is incremented by :math:`nFPC` frames every time a new chunk is
  published on the port, it is important to check that it will not overflow. The
  index is therefore coded as an unsigned integer on 64 bits (``unsigned long
  long`` type. With a sample rate of 192kHz for instance, the order of magnitude
  of the index overflow is a million years).

Example of use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tutorial :ref:`sec-examples-tutorial-bass` is an example of use of |BASS|, using the
|matlab-genomix| bridge.  It shows how to invoke its services and how to
retrieve the streamed audio data in Matlab.
